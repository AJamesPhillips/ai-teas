Cotta\nBioenergy research Unit; national Center for Agricultural Utilization research; Agricultural research Service; US Department of Agriculture; Peoria, iL USA\nKeywords: recombinant ethanologenic Escherichia coli, ethanol fermentation, separate hydrolysis and fermentation, simultaneous saccharification and fermentation, lignocellulosic biomass\nIntroduction\nEthanol is a renewable oxygenated fuel. In the USA, about 13.23 billion gallons of fuel ethanol was produced in 2010, replacing the gasoline produced from some 445 million barrels of imported oil.1 Various agricultural residues (corn stover, wheat straw, barley straw, rice straw and sugarcane bagasse), processing byproducts (corn fiber and rice hulls), and energy crops (switchgrass and miscanthus) are available as low cost feedstocks for conversion to fuel ethanol. The production of ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass generally involves four steps\u2014feedstock pretreatment, enzymatic saccharification, fermentation and product recovery. The pretreatment of any lignocellulosic biomass is crucial before enzymatic hydrolysis.2 Furthermore, any lignocellulosic biomass, upon pretreatment and enzymatic saccharification, produces a mixture of sugars such as glucose, xylose, arabinose and galactose.\nThe utilization of all the sugars generated from lignocellulosic biomass is essential for the economic production of ethanol.3 The conventional ethanol fermenting yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) or bacterium (Zymomonas mobilis) cannot ferment pentose sug- ars to ethanol.4 One major technical hurdle to converting any lignocellulosic feedstock to ethanol is the development of an appropriate microorganism for fermentation of both hexose and pentose sugars. A number of recombinant microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Z. mobilis and S. cerevisiae\nhave been developed over the past 25 y with the express goal of fermenting both hexose and pentose sugars to ethanol simultane- ously.4 Herein, we review the production of ethanol by a recom- binant E. coli strain (FBR5) from various lignocellulosic biomass substrates.\nConstruction of Recombinant E. coli Strain FBR5\nThe ethanol pathway in S. cerevisiae and Z. mobilis requires only two enzymes, pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehy- drogenase. Ingram et al.5 inserted the genes encoding these two enzymes from Z. mobilis into E. coli under the control of a single enteric promoter to produce an artificial operon, desig- nated the pet operon, for the production of ethanol. The resultant recombinant E. coli strain produced high levels of ethanol from glucose. Later Ohta et al.6 integrated the pyruvate decarboxyl- ase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase II (adhB) genes into the E. coli chromosome within or near the pyruvate formate-lyase gene (pfl)). Strains carrying the pet operon in plasmid (e.g., E. coli B/pLOI297) or in chromosomal sites (e.g., E. coli KO11) require antibiotics in the medium to maintain genetic stability and high ethanol productivity.7 To overcome this requirement, Hespell et al.8 used the conditionally lethal E. coli strain FMJ39, which carries mutations for lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate formate lyase and grows aerobically but is incapable of anaerobic growth unless these mutations are complemented.9 E. coli strains FBR1 and FBR2 were created by transforming E. coli FMJ39 with the pet (production of ethanol) operon plasmids pLOI295 and pLOI297, respectively. Both strains continued to produce high levels of ethanol from glucose in the absence of antibiot- ics. However, the strain FMJ39 does not metabolize xylose. Dien et al.10 was able to isolate FMJ39 mutants that do metabolize xylose and then transformed one of these mutants with plas- mid pLOI297 which resulted in the new E. coli strain FBR3. The strain FBR3 selectively maintained the plasmid pLOI297 when grown anaerobically. Following 10 serial transfers of this strain in aerobic and anaerobic cultures containing either glu- cose or xylose with no selective antibiotics led to loss of the plas- mid from the aerobic cultures. An average of 97.4 \u00b1 3.5% of the cells maintained the plasmid in anaerobic cultures. The strain utilized 10% (w/v) each of glucose, xylose, arabinose or a mix- ture of these sugars [4% (w/v) glucose, 4% (w/v) xylose and 2% (w/v) arabinose] and produced 4.38\u20134.66% (w/v) ethanol.

Do not distribute\nLignocellulosic biomass, upon pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, generates a mixture of hexose and pentose sugars such as glucose, xylose, arabinose and galactose. while Escherichia coli utilizes all these sugars it lacks the ability to produce ethanol from them. recombinant ethanologenic E. coli strains have been created with a goal to produce ethanol from both hexose and pentose sugars. Herein, we review the current state of the art on the production of ethanol from lignocellulosic hydrolyzates by an ethanologenic recombinant E. coli strain (FBr5). The bacterium is stable without antibiotics and can tolerate ethanol up to 50 gL-1. it produces up to 45 g ethanol per L and has the potential to be used for industrial production of ethanol from lignocellulosic hydrolyzates.\nFigure 1. Construction of ethanologeic Escherichia coli strain FBr5. Details are available in references 12 and 11. Cm, chloroamphenicol; Kn, kanamycin; Ap, ampicilin; Tc, tetracycline\net al.11 used this approach to construct two additional E. coli strains with different genetic backgrounds. They introduced the plasmid pLOI297 into two new E. coli strains (DC1368 and NZN111) that also carry pfl and ldhA mutations.12 Unlike the parent strain (FMJ39x) for FBR3, the pfl mutation in these strains was intro- duced by genetic recombination and included an antibiotic resistance marker which is the gene for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) responsible for conferring resistance to chror- amphenicol (Cm). These two recombinant E. coli strains were named FBR4 and FBR5, respectively. Serial transfer experiments demonstrated that the ethanol plasmid was stably maintained in the absence of antibiotics.11 E. coli FBR5 performed better than FBR4 in ethanol production from corn fiber hydrolyzate. Figure 1 shows an illustration outlining the construction of the recombi- nant E. coli strain FBR5. Nichols et al.13 constructed ethanolo- genic E. coli strains with the glucose phospho-transferase (ptsG) mutation. The mutants (FBR14, FBR16) had an altered pattern of mixed sugar utilization\u2014xylose and arabinose were simultane- ously consumed as fast as glucose, suggesting that the catabolic pathways for xylose and arabinose were fully activated despite the presence of glucose in the medium (FBR16). The fumarate dehy- drogenase gene (\u0394frdABCD) was further deleted in the mutant FBR16, preventing the production of succinic acid to minimize byproduct formation. However, ptsG- also disables active glucose transport in E. coli strain FBR16. For this reason, the mutants grew slower on glucose and were more sensitive to inhibitors pres- ent in corn fiber hydrolyzate than FBR5.14\nFermentation of Mixed Sugars\nDien et al.11 investigated the fermentation of xylose (7.62%, w/v) and mixed sugars (7.62%, w/v) containing glucose (3.05%), xylose (3.05%) and arabinose (1.52%) by the recombinant E. coli FBR5; revealing that it produced 3.34 \u00b1 0.04 and 3.40 \u00b1 0.05% (w/v) ethanol from xylose and mixed sugars with the ethanol pro- ductivity of 0.66 \u00b1 0.01 and 0.92 \u00b1 0.04 gL-1h-1, respectively. The strain produced 39.2 to 41.5 g ethanol from 95 g xylose per L with ethanol productivity of 0.59 gL-1h-1. Qureshi et al.15 inves- tigated substrate and product inhibition and kinetic parameters for ethanol production from xylose by the strain. The culture could tolerate very high xylose concentrations (up to 250 gL-1) in the medium. The maximum ethanol produced from xylose was\n43.5 gL-1 and the bacterium tolerated a maximum of 50 g ethanol per L. In pH controlled experiments, the maximum ethanol pro- ductivity of 0.90 gL-1h-1 was obtained from xylose (90 gL-1). The strain tolerated up to a maximum 40 g salt (sodium chloride) per L of fermentation broth but showed inhibition of growth at above 10 g salt per L.15\nFermentation of Lignocellulosic Hydrolyzates\nThe ethanol production from wheat straw by various pretreat- ments (hydrothermal, dilute acid, concentrated acid, lime, alka- line peroxide and microwave), enzymatic saccharification and batch fermentations of both non-detoxified and detoxified (by overliming) hydrolyzates by both separate hydrolysis and fermen- tation (SHF) and simultaneous saccharification and fermenta- tion (SSF) using the recombinant E. coli strain FBR5 has been investigated in detail.16-19 Integration of process steps is important in lowering the cost of the production of ethanol from any ligno- cellulosic feedstock.3 SSF is an option that is considered a neces- sary step in this regard.20 The optimal pH and temperature for the enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated wheat straw and rice hulls were at 5.0 and 45\u201350\u00b0C.17,21 However, the recombinant E. coli FBR5 performed well at pH 6.5 and 35\u00b0C.11 In SSF experiments, a compromi+sed pH of 6.0 and temperature at 35\u00b0C were used. The minimum and maximum ethanol produced from pretreated wheat straw (86 gL-1) in these studies were 13.0 \u00b1 2.0 and 22.5 \u00b1 0.6 gL-1, respectively. The ethanol yields varied between 0.37 to 0.50 gg-1 available sugars depending on the type of pretreatment used. The fermentation time also varied greatly from 17 to 136 h which was also highly dependent of the type of pretreatment and the inhibitory compounds present in the hydrolyzate. Figure 2 shows the patterns of utilization of glucose, xylose, arabinose and total sugars and production of ethanol by the strain from alkaline peroxide pretreated and enzymatically saccharified wheat straw hydrolyzate.18 It is evident that the strain utilized glucose first, then arabinose and finally xylose at a slower rate, even though it did completely utilize xylose. Similar patterns of mixed sugar utilization were also observed in other pretreated hydrolyzates16,17,19,21-24 and with another ethanologenic recombi- nant E. coli ATCC 11,303 carrying plasmid pLOI297.25 Saha et al.21-24 obtained a maximum ethanol production of 18.7 \u00b1 0.6 gL-1 in 64 h from dilute acid pretreated rice hulls (150 gL-1) and 11.9 \u00b1 0.0 g ethanol per L in 17 h from alkaline peroxide pre- treated barley straw (100 gL-1) by SHF. Recently, Saha et al.26 studied ethanol production by recombinant E. coli strain FBR5 from dilute acid pretreated wheat straw by SHF and SSF in detail. The yield of total sugars from dilute acid (0.5% H2SO4) pretreated (160\u00b0C, 10 min) and enzymatically saccharified (pH 5.0, 45\u00b0C, 72 h) wheat straw (86 gL-1) was 50.0 \u00b1 1.4 gL-1. The hydrolyzate contained 1,184 \u00b1 19 mg furfural and 161 \u00b1 1 mg hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) per L which are toxic byprod- ucts. The recombinant E. coli FBR5 showed no growth at pH controlled at 4.5 to 6.5 in the non-abated wheat straw hydrolyzate at 35\u00b0C. However, it produced 21.9 \u00b1 0.3 g ethanol per L from non-abated wheat straw hydrolyzate (total sugars, 44.1 \u00b1 0.4 gL-1) in 90 h including the lag time of 24 h when pH was controlled\n198 Bioengineered volume 3 issue 4\nFigure 2. Time course of ethanol production by recombinant Escherichia coli FBr5 from alkaline H2O2 pretreated (2.15%, w/v, pH 11.5, 3 h) and enzymatically saccharified (45\u00b0C, pH 5.0, 120 h) wheat straw (8.6%, w/v) hydrolyzate at pH 6.5 and 35\u00b0C. The data presented are averages of two individual experiments. Symbols: \u25cf, glucose; \u25cb, xylose; \u25bc, arabinose; \u2206, total sugars; \u25a0, ethanol; \u25a1, cell density. From reference 18.\nat pH 7.0 and 35\u00b0C (SHF). It appears that this E. coli strain was able to metabolize furfural, HMF and acetic acid at pH 7.0. This finding is both important and encouraging because it provides an option of running the fermentation at pH 7.0 for SHF pro- cess without detoxifying the hydrolyzate. The bacterium pro- duced 21.6 \u00b1 0.5 g ethanol per L in 40 h from the bioabated and enzymatically saccharified wheat straw hydrolyzate (total sugars, 44.1 \u00b1 0.4 g) at pH 6.0 and 35\u00b0C. The bioabatement of wheat straw was performed by growing Coniochaeta ligniaria NRRL 30616,27 in the liquid portion of the pretreated wheat straw aero- bically at pH 6.5 and 30\u00b0C for 15 h. The recombinant E. coli strain FBR5 produced 24.9 \u00b1 0.3 g ethanol per L in 96 h and 26.7 \u00b1 0.0 g ethanol per L in 72 h from bioabated wheat straw hydrolyzate by batch and fed-batch SSF, respectively. SSF offered a distinct advantage over SHF with respect to reducing the total time required to produce ethanol from the bioabated wheat straw by the recombinant E. coli strain FBR5. However, mixing is one of the major problems of using SSF for ethanol production from lignocellulosic feedstocks. By feeding the pretreated wheat straw 3 times in the reactor (fed-batch approach), Saha et al.26 were able to complete the fermentation of bioabated wheat straw within 72 h. Fed-batch SSF performed better than the batch SSF with respect to shortening the time requirement and increase in ethanol yield.\nDien et al.11 reported that the recombinant E. coli strain FBR5 produced a maximum of 30\u201342 g ethanol per L in 60 h from xylose (95 gL-1) with ethanol yields of 86\u201392% of theoretical in batch culture. Qureshi et al.15 showed that the maximum ethanol that could be produced by the strain from xylose in batch culture was 43.5 gL-1. Increasing the ethanol titer in the fermentation broth is crucially important for cost reduction of cellulosic etha- nol production due to the high energy demand for ethanol recov- ery by distillation.28 An ethanol concentration of 40 gL-1 or above in the fermentation broth could be considered as a bench mark for economically viable distillation.29 Saha et al.30 studied the ethanol production by the recombinant bacterium from wheat straw at high solids loading. The yield of total sugars from dilute acid (0.75% H2SO4, v/v) pretreated (160\u00b0C, 10 min) wheat straw (150 gL-1) after enzymatic saccharification at pH 5.0 and 45\u00b0C for 72 h was 86.3 \u00b1 1.5 gL-1. The pretreated wheat straw was bio-abated by growing C. ligniaria NRRL 30616,27 aerobically in the liquid portion for 16 h. The recombinant E. coli strain FBR5 produced 41.1 \u00b1 1.1 g ethanol per L from non-abated wheat straw hydrolyzate (total sugars, 86.6 \u00b1 0.3 gL-1) in 168 h at pH 7.0 and 35\u00b0C (SHF). The bacterium produced 41.8 \u00b1 0.0 g ethanol per L in 120 h from the bioabated wheat straw by SHF. It pro- duced 41.6 \u00b1 0.7 g ethanol per L in 120 h from bioabated wheat straw by fed-batch SSF. The fed-batch SSF was started with one- fourth of the pretreated solid material in the fermentation broth and the remaining three portions were added at 16, 21 and 24 h. This approach helped significantly with the high solids (150 gL-1) mixing problem. This is the first report of the production of > 40 g ethanol per L from a lignocellulosic hydrolyzate by this recombinant bacterium. A summary of the fermentation activity of recombinant E. coli FBR5 from dilute acid pretreated wheat straw hydrolyzate is presented in Table 1.\nLiu et al.31,32 evaluated the performance of E. coli FBR5 for ethanol production from dilute acid hydrolyzate of hot water wood extract. Its growth was strongly inhibited in the dilute acid hydrolyzate of hot-water wood extract. The strain was then challenged by hot water wood extract (containing 59.1 g reduc- ing sugars per L). After repeated strain adaptation, an improved strain FBHW was obtained. This E. coli strain FBHW was resis- tant to toxicity of the hydrolyzate in the fermentation medium containing concentrated hydrolyzate and xylose was completely utilized by the strain to produce ethanol. The strain FBHW was grown in the concentrated hydrolyzate without any detoxifica- tion. The yield of ethanol was 36.8 gL-1 of fermentation broth in 96 h. Sanny et al.33 further engineered E. coli FBR5 using three different contructs, to contain and express Vitreoscilla hemoglo- bin gene (vgh). The three resulting strains expressed Viteoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) at various levels, and the production of ethanol was inversely proportional to the expressed VHb level. High levels of VHb were correlated with an inhibition of ethanol production. However, the strain with the lowest VHb expres- sion (approximately the normal induced level in Vitreoscilla), produced more ethanol than the parental strain FBR5 with glu- cose, xylose or corn stover hydrolyzate as the predominant carbon source under microaerobic condition in shake flasks.\nStability of Recombinant E. coli FBR5\nMartin et al.34 studied the stability of the ethanologenic E. coli strain FBR5 during continuous culture on glucose or xylose. They obtained stable ethanol yields of about 80\u201385% of the theoretical on glucose (50 gL-1) or xylose (50 gL-1) over 26 d at dilution rates of 0.075 h-1 for glucose and 0.045 h-1 for xylose under chemostat conditions using this strain. Recently, Saha and Cotta35 studied the long-term performance of this recombi- nant bacterium in a series of continuous culture runs (16\u2013105 d)\nTable 1. Summary of fermentation of dilute acid pretreated wheat straw by recombinant Escherichia coli FBr5 at 35\u00b0C26,30\nThe dilute acid pretreatment of wheat straw (86 gL-1, 0.5% H2SO4, v/v; 150 gL-1, 0.75% H2SO4, v/v) was performed at 160oC for 10 min. enzymatic sac- charification was performed at pH 5.0 and 45oC for 72 h with a cocktail of 3 commercial enzyme (cellulase, \u03b2-glucosidase, and hemicellulase) prepara- tions. For wheat straw (86 g/L), fed-batch SSF was performed by adding the substrate 3 times (0, 16 and 24 h) in 3 equal portions. washed solid was prepared by separating the liquid portion of pretreated wheat straw and washing the residue with water. For wheat straw (150 gL-1), fed-batch SSF was performed by adding the substrate 4 times (0, 16, 21 and 24 h) in 4 equal portions.

The average ethanol produced from the available sugars (21.9 to 47.8 gL-1) ranged from 8.8 to 17.3 gL-1 (0.28 to 0.45 gg-1 available sugars, 0.31 to 0.48 gg-1 sugar consumed) with ethanol productivity of 0.27 to 0.78 gL-1h-1 in a set of 14 continuous culture runs (16\u2013105 d). During these studies, no loss of ethanol productiv- ity was observed which indicates that the strain showed robustness in performance. The time courses of the pro- duction of ethanol and succinic acid, growth (cell mass) and residual xylose concentration are shown in Figure 3 for a set of two continuous cultures run up to 105 d. On average, about 11.2% of total sugars (22.8% of xylose) were left unutilized. Glucose was almost completely uti- lized. A disadvantage of recombinant E. coli strain FBR5 is that the fumarate reductase enzyme apparently functions in strain FBR5, since none of the four subunit genes were\nFermentation type\nFermentation time (h)\nTotal sugars (gL-1)\nEthanol (gL-1)\nEthanol productivity (gL-1h-1)\nEthanol yield (gg-1 sugar)\nEthanol (gg-1 straw)\nWheat straw (86 gL-1)\nNon-abated\nSHF (pH 7.0)\n90\n44.1 \u00b1 0.4\n21.9 \u00b1 0.3\n0.24\n0.50\n0.25\nSSF (pH 7.0)\n96\n-\n17.4 \u00b1 1.8\n0.18\n0.39\n0.20\nBioabated\nSHF (pH 6.5)\n66\n44.1 \u00b1 0.4\n21.6 \u00b1 0.5\n0.33\n0.49\n0.25\nSSF (pH 6.0)\n96\n-\n24.9 \u00b1 0.3\n0.26\n-\n0.29\nFed-batch SSF (ph 6.0)\n72\n-\n26.7 \u00b1 0.0\n0.37\n-\n0.31\nWashed solids\nSSF (pH 6.0)\n96\n-\n12.2 \u00b1 0.3\n0.13\n-\n0.14\nWheat straw (150 gL-1)\nSHF\nnon-abated (pH 7.0)\n168\n86.6 \u00b1 0.3\n41.1 \u00b1 1.1\n0.24\n0.47\n0.27\nBioabated (pH 6.5)\n120\n86.6 \u00b1 0.3\n41.8 \u00b1 0.0\n0.35\n0.48\n0.28\nSSF\nnon-abated (pH 7.0)\n-\n-\n0.0\n-\n-\n-\nBioabated (pH 6.0)\n104\n41.6 \u00b1 0.7\n0.40\n-\n0.28\ndisrupted allowing the production of considerable quantities of succinic acid.11,34 The fumarate reductase is only expressed anaerobically. Relatively stable succinic acid production (1.4\u2013 3.1 gL-1) was observed in all these continuous culture experi- ments performed. Similar quantities (1.0\u20133.0 gL-1) of succinic acid were produced by the recombinant E. coli FBR5 over the course of continuous culture experiments using 50 g glucose or xylose per L as feedstock.34\nMartin et al.34 reported that the maximum ethanol concentra- tion achievable in continuous cultures is frequently limited by the ethanol tolerance of the recombinant bacterium. Qureshi et al.15 reported that the maximum ethanol tolerance of the strain FBR5 was 50 gL-1. Asghari et al.36 reported that recombinant E. coli strain K011 produced about 45 gL-1 ethanol from hemicel- lulose hydrolyzates of agricultural residues (bagasse, corn stover and corn hulls). The ethanol productivity by the recombinant E. coli FBR5 was decreased by 36% when the additional ethanol concentration was increased from 1.5 to 2.5%.35\nLawford and Rousseau7 investigated the factors contributing to the loss of ethanologenicity of E. coli B recombinants pLOI297 and K011 employing glucose- or xylose limited chemostat cul- tures. Both recombinant strains carry markers (cat gene) for antibiotic resistance. Strain KO11 expressed high levels of cat and was a spontaneous mutant that was selected to high levels (600 \u03bcgmL-1) of chloroamphenicol. However, both recombinant strains exhibited rapid loss of ethanologenicity in chemostat cul- tures with glucose even when the selection pressure was imposed by the inclusion of antibiotics in the feed medium. Under xylose limitation, the plasmid-bearing recombinant E. coli strains appeared to be stabilized by antibiotics. These authors concluded that based on an average cost for large bulk quantities of antibiot- ics at $55 kg-1 and an inclusion level of 40 mgL-1 of fermentation medium, the estimated economic impact regarding the potential stabilization by antibiotics in a plant operating in batch mode, the antibiotics cost can be $0.29 gal-1 of ethanol for antibiotic addition in all fermentation media. Thus, the stable nature of E. coli strain FBR5 without antibiotics is advantageous for indus- trial production of ethanol from a lignocellulosic hydrolyzate as the antibiotic use will not only add extra cost but also create envi- ronmental problems.\nMartin et al.34 suggests that if the E. coli FBR5 would have lost the plasmid, the revertant strain would simply be the host strain NZN111. This host strain does not produce ethanol.11,12 In conclusion, the recombinant E. coli FBR5 performed very well over the periods studied with respect to stability and viability without any antibiotics. The information is very\nimportant for the use of the recombinant bacterium for contin- uous production of ethanol from lignocellulosic hydrolyzates. Based on the results of the continuous culture experiments, we have studied the production of ethanol by the recombinant strain E. coli FBR5 at the pilot scale (100 L) level using dilute acid pretreated wheat straw as a feedstock in order to dem- onstrate the performance of the strain for large scale ethanol production from lignocellulosic hydrolyzates. The results have not yet published.\nConcluding Remarks and Future Directions for Research\nThe recombinant E. coli strain FBR5 performs well in the absence of antibiotics. Under proper conditions, it can ferment all sugars including xylose and arabinose to ethanol quantitatively and is also somewhat tolerant to common fermentation inhibitors such as furfural, HMF and acetic acid. It works better at neutral or near neutral pH range which makes the SSF process using the recombinant bacterium to run at a compromising pH 6.0. In comparison, the conventional yeast performs optimally at pH 4.5\u20135.0 which is also the optimum pH for action of cellulase and hemicellulase enzymes. The cost of enzymes remains a concern. Approaches can be taken to clone and express cellulase enzymes in the ethanologenic recombinant E. coli strain. The maximum ethanol tolerance of recombinant E. coli strain FBR5 is 50 gL-1. Research needs to be performed to increase the ethanol tolerance of the bacterium. Even though considerable research has been done on the production of ethanol by the recombinant bacterial strain, no pilot plant demonstration of the fermentation process has been performed. To our knowledge, no studies have been done on the optimization of fermentation medium components which is also an essential part to lower the ethanol production cost. Moreover, there is no data available on the utilization of the post fermentation left-over materials including the E. coli cells for use as animal feed or for generating electricity after the prod- uct ethanol has been removed from the fermentation broth by distillation. These issues need to be addressed not only for etha- nologenic recombinant E. coli strains but also for recombinant S. cerevisiae before their use industrially.\nNote\nMention of trade names or commercial products in this article is solely for the purpose of providing specific information and does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the US Department of Agriculture.\n"

Bioref. 10:299\u2013315 (2016); DOI: 10.1002/bbb\nBiodiesel production by transesterifi cation\nBiodiesel production from the extracted lipids follows \nthe process model developed in a previous study.2 Th e \nprocess consists of transesterifi cation, biodiesel purifi -\ncation, and glycerol recovery and purifi cation (Fig. 1). \nTransesterifi cation of the lipids with methanol, catalyzed \nby sodium methoxide, is conducted as a continuous reac-\ntion in a stirred tank reactor at 60 \u00b0C. Th e transesterifi ca-\ntion process continuously converts lipids and methanol to \nbiodiesel and glycerol. Following a 1 h transesterifi cation \nreaction, a continuous centrifuge is used to remove the \nglycerol-rich coproduct phase, which is sent to the glycerol \nrecovery unit. Th e biodiesel stream, which also contains \nunreacted methanol and lipids, is fed to a second reac-\ntion tank, wheremore sodium methoxide and methanol \nare added. Th e second transesterifi cation reaction is con-\nducted for1 hr. A transesterifi cation effi  ciency of 90% was \nassumed for each of the two transesterifi cation-reactions, \nwhich resulted inan overall effi  ciency of 99% based on the \nlipid content.2, 36 Th e unreacted methanol is recovered \nby vacuum evaporation followed by condensation for \nrecycling.\nTh e crude biodiesel stream is washed with hydrochloric \nacid and water to neutralize the catalyst (sodium meth-\noxide) and convert any soap to free fatty acids, thereby \nreducing the fl uid emulsifying tendencies. A continuous \ncentrifuge is then used to separate the biodiesel from the \naqueous phase. A vacuum drying process is applied to \nreduce the water content to 450 ppm. Th e crude glycerol \nstream is treated with the same process (hydrochloric acid \nand then caustic solution), and the processed crude glyc-\nerol has a purity of 80%.2\nEthanol production by fermentation\nAs in a modern sugarcane plant, the sugar solution is con-\ncentrated to 20% solute through a multiple eff ect evapora-\ntor (Fig. 1). Th e concentrated sugar solutionis cooled to \n32  \u00b0C and fed into the fermenters, where a fermentation \nprocess with yeast is conducted. During fermentation, \nyeasts convert the sugars to ethanol and carbon dioxide. \nCooling water is continuously provided to keep the fer-\nmentation temperature at 32 \u00b0C. Aft  er fermentation, the \nwine (water, ethanol, and yeast mix) is sent to centrifuges \nto separate the yeasts, which are treated with sulfuric acid \nsolution to prevent bacterial contamination and recycled \nfor use in further fermentation batches.\nAft  er removing the yeasts, the wine is sent to the distil-\nlation process to recover the ethanol. Before being sent \nto the distillation column, the wine is preheated in heat \nthe harvest machines, to prevent potential damage to the \nmill tandem, i.e. several crushing and extraction units \nin sequence. No washing is carried out on the lipid-cane \nprior to crushing due to the high sugar and lipid losses \nthat would result from washing mechanically harvested \nlipid-cane prior to extraction.30\nLipid/sugar extraction\nShredders are used to cut the lipid-canestem to enhance \nthe lipid and sugar extraction in the extraction step \n(Fig. 1). Th e juice extraction of the shredded lipid-cane \nfollows the current well-established mechanical method \n(mill tandem) in sugarcane industry, with the assistance \nof enzymatic hydrolysis. During the extraction, process \ncondensed water (imbibition water) at 60 \u00b0C is added at the \nfi nal stage of the tandem to improve the lipid and sugar \nrecovery. Protease enzyme is added at 0.5% concentration, \nto break down proteins, including oleosin that surrounds \nthe lipid bodies.32 Enzymes have been successfully applied \nto enhance aqueous extraction of lipids from diff erent \nbiomass materials.33\u201335 Th e extracted juice contains water, \nlipids, sugar, and impurities such as fi ber fragments, min-\nerals, and soil particles. A rotary screen is used to remove \nthe fi ber fragments from the juice; these are returned to \nthe mills for further recovery of lipids and sugar, and \nthe juice is sent to the clarifi cation process. Based on the \ninformation collected from sugarcane and soybean pro-\ncessing plants, it is assumed that 90% of the lipids and 96% \nof the sugar are extracted from the lipid-cane. A sensitivity \nanalysis is conducted to evaluate the eff ect of the extrac-\ntion effi  ciency on the process economic performance.\nTh e extracted juice is piped to a temporary storage tank \nthat provides  a constant feed to the juice treatment pro-\ncess (Fig. 1). Th e juice is heated from 35 to 70 \u00b0C, followed \nby the addition of phosphoric acid to reduce the pH to 4.5 \nand followed by the addition of lime (calcium hydroxide) \nto increase the pH to 7 to remove impurities by forming \ncalcium phosphate particles. A second heating is then \napplied to the juice to increase the temperature to 105 \u00b0C \nto remove dissolved air. Flocculant polymer is added to \nseparate fi ne fi ber fragments and soil particles from the \njuice in a settling tank. Th e juice then separates into three \nparts: lipids fl oating on the top, a sugar solution, and a \nmud debris of solid particles at the bottom of the settling \ntank. Th e mud is washed with fresh water to recover the \nremaining sugar using a rotary vacuum fi lter. Th e washed \nsolution is recycled to the process prior to the settling \ntank, and the remaining material on the fi lter, termed fi lter \ncake, may be used as a component of animal feed or for \ncomposting.27 19321031, 2016, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bbb.1640 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [02/02/2024].

Bioref. 10:299\u2013315 (2016); DOI: 10.1002/bbb\nTo meet the target of 96 million-liters/yr for biodiesel \nproduction, the required mass of soybeans to be crushed \nis approximately 500 000 MT/yr. With an expected 330 \nworking days per year, the required throughput is approxi-\nmately 1500 MT/day. Th e soybeans contain 13% water, 18% \nlipids, 37% crude protein, 28% carbohydrates, and 4% ash. \nTh e process includes two parts: (i) soybean crushing and \noil refi ning and (ii) biodiesel production from refi ned oil \n(Fig. 2). Th e key parameters are provided in Table 3. Aft  er  \nreceiving the soybeans, the fi rst step is to clean them to \nremove foreign materials, such as stems, pods, dirt, sand, \nand rocks, because such foreign materials reduce the oil \nand protein content and adversely aff ect oil quality. Th e \ncleaned soybeans are sent to a dehulling process to remove \ntheir hulls, which are toasted and grinded before being \ntransported to a storage room. Aft  er the dehulling process, \nthe cracked soybeans are subjected to conditioning, fl ak-\ning, and expending processes, which help extract oil in \nthe following extraction step. Th e soybean fl akes are then \nsent to the oil extraction process, where hexane is used \nas a solvent to extract the oil. Th e oil extraction effi  ciency \nis assumed to be 95%, based on the data collected from a \nsoybean plant.  Th e hexane in the oil and the spent soy-\nbean fl akes is then evaporated and recycled. Th e spent soy-\nbean fl akes are ground to produce soybean meal and are \nsold as animal feed. Th e hexane-free soy oil is referred to \nas crude soy oil and is sent to the oil refi ning process.\nexchangers by the fl ow coming from the bottom of the \ndistillation column. Th e fi rst step in the ethanol recovery \nis the distillation column, which captures nearly all of the \nethanol in the wine. Th e distillated ethanol solution con-\ntains almost an equal amount of water, so a second stage \nof distillation (rectifi er column) is used. Upon completion \nof this second stage, the distillate is approximately 90% \nethanol, and molecular sieves then remove further water \nto provide ethanol of 99% purity (w/w). Th e bottom fl ow \nfrom the distillation column, termed vinasse, contains \nwater and nutrients including protein, fi bers, and other \nunfermentable chemicals. Th is material can be utilized for \nboth the irrigation and fertilization of the cane plantations \nthat surround the ethanol production facility.27\nCogeneration system\nBagasse, a byproduct of the lipid-cane process, is burned \nto produce steam and generate electricity for the plant, \nwith the excess sold to the grid for additional revenue. \nTh e cogeneration units comprise a combustor for burning \nbagasse, a boiler for generating steam, and a turbogenerator \nfor converting thermal energy to electricity (Fig. 1). Such a \ncogeneration system using wet biomass has been included \nin aprocess model developed by the National Renewable \nEnergy Laboratory (NREL).31 Th e conceptual design and \ntechnical data in the NREL report were utilized for the \nsimulation of the cogeneration unit in this study. \nBagasse with 50% moisture content is fed to the combus-\ntor to be burned to generate heat. Th e total heating value \nis calculated by the imbedded combustor-modules in the \nSuperPro Designer based on the material composition. Th e \nboiler effi  ciency was assumed to be 80%.31 Flue gas leaving \nthe boiler preheats the air required to burn the bagasse. A \nturbogenerator uses a multistage turbine with two steam \nextraction ports and a fi nal condenser. Th e fi rst extracted \nsteam (1.48 MPa, 268 \u00b0C) is used to preheat the water \nbefore entering the boiler. Th e second steam is extracted \nat 0.44 MPa (152 \u00b0C) and is used in ethanol distillation, \njuice heating, and other processes. Th e rest of the steam is \ncondensed at 10 kPa (45.8 \u00b0C) to maximally increase the \nelectricity production. \nSoy-biodiesel process\nTh e soy-biodiesel process model is based on the model \ndeveloped by the USDA ARS (Agricultural Research \nService) research lab (unpublished). Th e capacity of the \nsoy-biodiesel plant was set to 96 million liters (25 million \ngallons) biodiesel per year, which is the same as the capac-\nity of the lipid-cane (20% lipid content) processing plant. \nTable 3.

Th is number agrees with previ-\nous studies, where the ethanol yield per MT of sugarcane \nwas between 82 and 93 liters.27, 29, 42, 45 Th ese results con-\nfi rm the validity of the data obtained from our model \nand the assumptions considered. For the lipid-cane with \n2% lipids, 6.0 liters of biodiesel and 79.9 liters of ethanol \nwere produced per MT of lipid-cane. As the lipid con-\ntent increases, the ethanol production decreases, but the \nbiodiesel production increases. Th is result makes sense \nbecause more sugar was diverted to produce oil. For the \nlipid-cane with 20% lipids, 60.1 liters of biodiesel can be \nproduced from each MT of lipid-cane, but no ethanol \nwas produced due to the little sugar remaining in the \nlipid-cane. \nElectricity from bagasse plays an important role in mod-\nern sugarcane processing plants.46\u201348 In the sugarcane \nplant, bagasse is burned to produce steam and electricity \nfor the plant,46 with the surplus electricity sold to the grid \nto generate co-product credits. Th e steam and electric-\nity requirements for the processes of soybean biodiesel, \nsugarcane, and lipid-cane with 10 and 20% lipid contents \nare shown in Table 7. It is worth notice that the steam \nrequirement for the lipid-cane with 20% lipid was sig-\nnifi cantly lower compared to that for the sugarcane and \nlipid-cane with 10% lipid. Th is is because all sucrose has \nbeen converted to TAGs in this scenario and so there is \nno fermentation or ethanol evaporation when lipid-cane \nwith 20% lipid, so the steam usage was low. Th e electric-\nity used by the sugarcane and lipid-cane processing plants \nwere between 50 000 and 53 000 MWh per year, which \ncorresponded to approximately 31 to 33 MWh per MT of \nsugarcane processed. It is should be noted that due to the \ncombustion of bagasse, no external energies (i.e., fossil \nfuel) is needed at modern the sugarcane processes. Th is \nmakes sugarcane process self-sustainable in energy.29\nTh e surplus electricity production is approximately 61 \nkWh per MT of sugarcane (Fig. 3). Th is number is slightly \nlower than the previously reported value of 68 kWh per \nMT of sugarcane.29 According to the UNICA report, up \nto 96 kWh total electricity (electricity used in the  process \nTable 6.

Th e remaining sugar \nin the 2% lipid-cane was fermented to produce ethanol \nat a production cost of $0.46/liter, which could further \nimprove the economics of the lipid-cane process. With the \nincrease in lipid content, both the biodiesel and ethanol \nproduction costs from the lipid-cane decreased accord-\ningly. As the lipid content increased to 5%, the biodiesel \nand ethanol production costs decreased to $0.84 and \n$0.44/liter, respectively. Th e lower production cost of lipid-\ncane is primarily attributed to the lower feedstock cost \nof lipid-cane compared with that of soybean. As the lipid \ncontent increased to 20%, the biodiesel production cost \nfurther decreased to $0.59/liter, which made it competitive \nwith petroleum diesel. \nTh e details of the unit production costs of processes with \ndiff erent feedstocks are shown in Table 8.

Furthermore, only 90% of the lipids in \nthe lipid-cane were extracted in the extraction process, \nwhere as the rest 10% of the lipids remained in bagasse \nand was burned in the cogeneration system, which further \nincreased the electricity production.\nTh e resulting unit production costs for biodiesel and \nethanol are shown in Fig. 4.

For all processes, raw material costs constituted \nthe largest portion of the total operating cost, and of the \nraw material costs, the feedstock costs (i.e., soybeans, sug-\narcane, and lipid-cane) accounted for the largest portion. \nTh erefore, feedstock costs are the main contributor to the \nbiodiesel and ethanol production costs. Similar estimates \nthat the feedstock cost was the greatest contribution to \nthe biodiesel production cost were reported in other stud-\nies.2,11,49 Due to the lower feedstock cost, the biodiesel pro-\nduction cost from the lipid-cane process is lower than that \nfrom the soybean process.\nProfi tability analysis\nBecause the lipid-cane process has a much higher total \ncapital investment than the soy-biodiesel process does, \nthe lower biofuel unit production cost of the lipid-cane \nprocess may not necessary indicate a better economic \nperformance. Th erefore, the IRR was calculated to evalu-\nate the economic performance of each scenario (Fig. 5). \nDespite the lower unit biodiesel production cost compared \nwith the conventional soy-biodiesel process, the process of \nlipid-cane with 2% lipid content had a lower IRR due to its \nhigher total capital investment. However, it has a slightly \nhigher IRR than the normal sugarcane process. Th e IRR \nvalue of the lipid-cane process increases as the lipid con-\ntent increases. When the lipid content increases to 5%, the \nIRR value of the lipid-cane process becomes comparable \nto that of the soy-biodiesel process. For the 20% lipid cane, \nthere was no sugar left  in the stem; thus, no sugar separa-\ntion, fermentation, or distillation was needed in the pro-\ncess, which signifi cantly reduced the related capital and \nenergy costs. Th erefore, when the lipid content in the lipid-\ncane increased from 10 to 20%, the IRR value of the pro-\ncess increased remarkably from 17.5 to 24.0%. Th e IRR of \nthe 20% lipid content lipid-cane process was much higher \nthan that of the soybean process.\nSensitivity analysis\nSenstivity analyses were performed to test variables that \nwere uncertain and those were found to signifi cantly aff ect \nTable 8.

Th e fi rst case was the process of lipid-cane with 10% \nlipid concentrations, and the second case was the soybean-\nbiodiesel process. In both cases, low and high points were \nchosen, which were then combined to give an estimate of \nthe accumulated eff ect of the various parameters changes \non the biodiesel production costs (Fig. 7). \nFirst, we varied the cost of lipid-cane price, as there \nis signifi cant uncertainty regarding lipid-cane costs \nand these have a very large infl uence on the biodiesel \nproduction cost. Th e cost of lipid-cane price was based \non the average sugarcane price in 2013. It is possible that \nthe genetically modifi ed lipid-cane would have a higher \nprice compared to normal suagrcane, due to its higher \nlipid content and research investment. Th e uncertainties \nin biomass yield of the lipid-cane would also infl uence \nits price. Th e lower biomass yield would probably cause \nthe increase of lipid-cane price to balance farmer\u2019s \nincome. However, it would also be very possible that \nbiomass might increase due to the synergy eff ect of lipid \naccumulation and carbon assimilation20, 50 and current \nresearch on photosynthesis improvements of crops.51 \nTh erefore, a larage variation of lipid-cane price ($25 to \n$45/MT) was selected for sensivitiy analysis. As the cane \nprice variates between $25/MT and $45/MT, the biodiesel \nproduction costs change broadly between $0.57/liter and \n$0.95/liter. \nBesides the lipid-cane price, the lipid extraction effi  -\nciency is also of importance. Since the lipid-cane is a new \nengineered crop to produce lipid, there is a signifi cant \nunceratinty redarding extraction effi  ciency. Th erefore, a \nrange of extraction effi  ciency from a low point (70%) to \na high point (95%) was selected for sensitivity analysis. \nInterstingly, its infl uence was not as large as other vari-\nables, such as lipid-cane prices, annual operating days and \nannual cursh capacity. Th is is mainly because the unex-\ntracted lipids were burned to produce electricity, which \nincreased the coproduct credits. Furthermore, glycerol \nselling prices had little infl uence on the biodiesel produc-\ntion costs. \nIn the case of the soybean biodiesel process, the soy-\nbean prices and soybean meals were the main targets for \nsensitivity analysis, since these two parameters had the \nlargest infl uence on the biodiesel production cost. Both \nparameters are uncertain due to the large fl uctuations of \nmarketing prices of soybean and soybean meals. In 2013, \nthe monthly average prices for soybean fl uctuated between \n$470 and $560 per MT, and the monthly average prices \nfor soybean meal fl uctuated between $450 and $520 per \nMT.52 By excluding the extreme prices, the soybean price \nbetween $490 and $550 per MT and the soybean meal \nprice between $450 and $500 per MT were conducted for \nsensitivity analysis.

Using the biofuel yields from \neach MT of sugarcane and lipid-cane, the biofuel produc-\ntion per hectare of land use can be determined. Figure \n8 shows that the biodiesel yield from soybeans is only \napproximately 500 liters per hectare of land use. For the \nlipid-cane, even with 2% lipid content, the biodiesel yield \nwas already higher than that from soybean. Meanwhile, it \ncan produce nearly 10 000 liters of ethanol by fermenting \nthe remaining sugars. Upon increasing the lipid content \nfrom 2 to 20%, the biodiesel yield increases, where as the \nethanol yield decreases because the sugar in the lipid-cane \nwas replaced with the lipids. For the lipid-cane with 20% \nlipid content, planting lipid-cane on one hectare of land \ncan produce more than 6700 liters of biodiesel, which \nis more than 10 times that of soybean. With such high \nbiodiesel production from each hectare of land, it only \nneeds about 0.76 Mha of land to meet the current US bio-\ndiesel requirement (5.1 billion liters).

Through process modeling, the study identifies key parameters influencing production costs and profitability, including lipid content in sugarcane, feedstock prices, and extraction efficiencies. It concludes that increasing lipid content in lipid-cane can significantly reduce biodiesel production costs and improve internal rate of return (IRR), making lipid-cane a potentially competitive alternative to soybeans for biofuel production. Additionally, lipid-cane could yield over ten times more biodiesel per hectare than soybeans, underscoring its potential as an efficient biofuel feedstock.",

Unlike traditional approaches which often focus on ethanol production from sugarcane or biodiesel production from oil crops like soybeans, this work integrates both biofuels into a single process using a novel feedstock. Furthermore, it incorporates a sensitivity analysis on key variables such as feedstock cost and lipid extraction efficiency, offering a detailed economic perspective.",

The proportion of the major biomass fractions (sugar, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) may vary in different sugarcane genotypes and growth environments and different parts of the plant. This study investigated the composition of mature and immature internodes, roots and mature leaves of sugarcane.\\n\\nResults\\n\\nInternodes were found to have a significantly larger alcohol-soluble component than leaves and roots. The primary difference between the immature and mature internodes was the ratio of soluble sugars. In mature tissues, sucrose content was significantly higher, whereas in immature internodal tissues there was lower sucrose and heightened concentrations of reducing sugars. Carbon (C) partitioning in leaf tissues was characterised by low levels of soluble components and high \u201cother\u201d and cell wall fractions. Root tissue had low ratios of soluble fractions relative to their cell wall contents, indicating a lack of storage of soluble carbon. There was no significant difference in the ratio of the major cell wall fractions between the major organ types. Characterisation of individual non-cellulosic monomers indicated leaf and root tissues had significantly higher arabinose and galactose fractions. Significantly larger proportions of syringyl lignin compounds and the hydroxycinnamic compound, p-coumaric acid were observed in mature internodal tissues compared to the other tissue types. Tissue-specific differences in composition were shown to greatly affect the recalcitrance of the cell wall to enzymatic saccharification.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nOverall, this study displayed clear evidence of the differential partitioning of C throughout the sugarcane plant in specific organs. These organ-specific differences have major implications in their utility as a bioproduct feedstock. For example, the inclusion of trash (leaves) with the culms (internodes) may alter processing efficiency.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nSugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrids), of the Saccharum genus, is a crop plant utilised primarily in the production of sucrose. More recently, the need has arisen to diversify the sugarcane industry beyond the focused production of sucrose, due to the falling prices of raw sugar throughout the past decade [1]. In response to this, the insoluble (fibre) fraction of sugarcane has been targeted as an ideal feedstock for the production of energy products, polymers and non-fossil-based chemicals [2], within a biorefinery system [3,4,5,6,7,8]. Producing a large amount of sugarcane fibre high in cellulose and low in hemicellulose and lignin would be highly desirable for the biorefinery industry [9]. Further, producing a hemicellulose fraction with low levels of pentose molecules and lignin would also be of significant value [10, 11]. The aforementioned factors are intrinsically linked to the way carbon (C) is partitioned within the mature sugarcane plant. Understanding where this C is partitioned within mature sugarcane plants will be key to the future development of this crop for use in biorefinery systems [12].\\n\\nInternodes, leaves, and roots utilise C in different ways throughout their life cycle, which in turn leads to distinct compositional profiles. Leaves are a source tissue, exporting over 80% of fixed photosynthates to sink tissues at maturity [13]. Conversely, root and internodal tissue are net importers of C in the form of sucrose, i.e. sink tissues, which is cleaved into uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose) to drive cell wall expansion, hydrolysed into glucose driving respiration, or retained as sucrose for storage, [14, 15]. There is an additional degree of difference in C partitioning between root and internodes. C partitioning in sugarcane internodal tissue is unique from other organs, as C utilisation changes from one focused primarily on respiration, cell wall and protein deposition i.e. meristematic sink, to that of storage of simple sugars in the form of sucrose, i.e. a storage sink [16]. Compositionally, the photosynthetic nature of sugarcane leaves leads to a heightened protein profile in comparison to mature internodal tissues [17, 18]. Further, cell wall analysis of mature sugarcane leaves displayed significantly higher lignin and arabinose profiles in comparison to whole culm samples [19]. A comparison of saccharification efficiency of the whole leaf vs. the whole culm displayed significant differences between the two tissue types [20]. There is a dearth of studies in sugarcane root composition [21], therefore no comparisons in composition or saccharification efficiency have been made.\\n\\nInternodal tissue is well characterised in sugarcane, whereby C partitioning into competing pools has been found to change greatly throughout maturity [13, 22,23,24]. Throughout internodal maturation, the bulk of C is allocated to the cell wall and respiratory pools in immature internodes, whereas in mature internodes the bulk of C is allocated to sucrose storage [16]. From a compositional perspective, C partitioning has a direct effect on the ratio of insoluble (cell wall, protein and other secondary metabolites) and soluble components (sugars). C partitioning to the major components in the insoluble fraction has been shown to fluctuate greatly during maturation, as displayed by high protein and hemicellulose in very young internodes, followed by a gradual increase in cellulose and lignin content until tissue maturity, between internodes 5 and 8 [25]. Within the soluble fraction, which is dominated by hexose and sucrose, hexose content is significantly higher in immature internodes, whereas in mature internodes sucrose dominates [23, 24, 26,27,28,29].\\n\\nDue to the economic importance of the sugarcane culm, the composition of individual internodes has been well characterised between varying levels of maturity, and between genotypes [16, 25, 30,31,32,33]. The composition in the other important organs of commercial sugarcane, i.e. roots and leaves, has not been characterised to the same extent as internodal tissues. This limits our understanding of compositional differences between different parts of the sugarcane plant, which in terms of total biomass produced are proportional to the culm [34]. Differences in composition between the major organs of sugarcane may have implications regarding their use in specific biorefinery applications. In this study, a combination of methods was utilised to evaluate the ratio of insoluble and soluble components of six different tissues, encapsulating the major organs of two commercial sugarcane genotypes. Characterising organ-specific compositional differences within sugarcane may have utility in the inclusion of by-products such as \u201ccane trash\u201d in biomass processing.\\n\\nResults\\n\\nThis study included the analysis of two commonly utilised commercial sugarcane genotypes KQ228 and Q208, within the Australian sugar industry. No significant compositional differences were observed between the two genotypes, as was expected due to their common lineage and phenotype [35]. Summary results for total biomass composition analysis on all 36 sugarcane samples utilised in this study are presented in Table 1. The percentage extractives on a DW basis fell between 12.9 and 73%. On an extractive free basis, or % of alcohol insoluble residue (AIR), the results were as follows, 14.5\u201331.3% cellulose, 9.9\u201325.5% hemicellulose, 7.9\u201332.2% lignin, 13.4\u201366% other and 0\u20136.2% ash. Figure\u00a01a (values presented as % at DW) displays the same data as presented in Table 1, with cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and other presented as % in AIR, whilst total extractives were presented as a % at DW. Within the five major components (other, extractives, lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose), total extractives have the widest variation compared to the other four ranges. A Pearson correlation test indicated a similar positive correlation between the major cell wall components cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin (Fig.\u00a01b). Cellulose has a similar correlation with lignin (R2\u2009=\u20090.86, p\u2009<\u20090.001), as hemicellulose and lignin (R2\u2009=\u20090.87, p\u2009<\u20090.001), whilst cellulose and hemicellulose have a higher correlation (R2\u2009=\u20090.93, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Total extractives were negatively correlated with lignin (R2\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.91, p\u2009<\u20090.001), hemicellulose (R2\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.87, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and cellulose (R2\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.84, p\u2009<\u20090.001) contents. The other fraction had a high negative correlation with extractives (R2\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.76, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and a weaker positive correlation with lignin (R2\u2009=\u20090.49, p\u2009<\u20090.001), hemicellulose (R2\u2009=\u20090.39, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and cellulose (R2\u2009=\u20090.31, p\u2009<\u20090.001).\\n\\nTable 1 Compositional summary statistics for 36 sugarcane samples across two commercial genotypes\\nFull size table\\nFig. 1\\n\\nSugarcane sampling schematic and overview of compositional statistics. a Labelled sugarcane plant schematic, as utilised in this study.

The other category presumably contains protein, cutins, uronic acids, ash, starch, organic acids and other hydrophobic compounds [30, 37, 38]. The breakdown of the extractives category is determined later in \u201cSoluble sugars\u201d. Overall, cell wall composition variation was observed across organ types and internodal development stage. Hemicellulose and lignin fractions were significantly higher in root (R) and leaf (L1 and L5) tissues compared to internode (TI, MI and BI) tissues. Cellulose content was also significantly higher in root (R) and leaf (L1 and L5) compared to internode (TI, MI and BI) tissues within the Q208 genotype; however, in KQ228 only mature internodal (BI and MI) tissues had significantly lower cellulose contents compared to leaf (L1 and L5) and root (R) tissues. The extractives fraction was significantly higher in all internode (TI, MI and BI) tissues, in comparison to root (R) and leaves (L1 and L5). The \u201cother\u201d fraction was determined significantly higher in leaf tissues (L1 and L5) in comparison to mature internode tissue (MI and BI).\\n\\nFig. 2\\n\\nContribution of Saccharum spp. hybrid major tissue components to total tissue composition.

S3, 4; Tables S4, 5). Sucrose content was significantly higher in mature internodal tissues MI and BI in both genotypes than in immature internodal tissue, roots and leaf tissues. In KQ228 genotype, the sucrose content of the BI tissue was significantly higher than that in MI tissue, whereas the opposite was observed in the Q208 genotype, whereby the sucrose content was significantly higher in the MI tissue. Fructose contents were significantly higher in immature internodal tissue in comparison to mature internodes (MI and TI), root and leaf tissues. Also, TI tissues have higher sucrose contents than mature internodal tissues (BI and MI), root and leaf tissues, although in the KQ228 genotype there was no significant difference between TI and MI tissues. Sucrose was the most abundant soluble sugar in mature internodal tissue, whereas glucose and fructose were equally the most abundant in immature internodal tissue. Within leaf tissue, glucose, fructose and sucrose levels were largely equal, whereas in root tissue hexose levels were higher than that of sucrose.\\n\\nFig. 3\\n\\nSoluble sugar, cell wall, hemicellulose and lignin contents in sugarcane. a Soluble sugar presented as a percentage of dry weight as determined by HPLC. b % Ratio of the three major cell wall components.

Statistical analysis was measured separately within each genotype\\n\\nFull size image\\nInsoluble C fraction\\nCell wall ratio\\n\\nThe ratio of the three major cell wall components, presented as a percentage, in each of the six tissues in both genotypes are presented in Fig.\u00a03b; Additional file 1: Figs. S5, 6; Tables S6, 7. Hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin percentages were deemed to not be significantly different between root, leaf and mature internodal tissues, due to the lack of consistency in results across both genotypes. A significant difference was observed between leaf tissues and immature internodal tissue (TI) across both genotypes, whereby lignin fractions were significantly lower in immature internodal tissue.\\n\\nNon-cellulosic sugar ratio\\n\\nThe determination of released non-cellulosic sugars from the TFA hydrolysis was completed using HPAEC. Four non-cellulosic fractions, mixed-link \u03b2-glucan (MLG, named as glucose in table), xylose, galactose and arabinose, are reported as a % of the total non-cellulosic fraction (Fig.\u00a03c; Additional file 1: Figs. S7, 8; Tables S8, 9). Other non-cellulosic components including fucose, rhamnose, galacturonic acid, glucuronic acid and mannose were also quantified; however, their content was too low to be accurately appraised. Arabinose in mature internode (MI and BI) was significantly lower than that of all other tissues in both genotypes. Arabinose was also significantly lower in all internodal tissues in comparison to root and leaf tissues, except for the TI tissue in genotype Q208. Galactose was significantly higher in root tissue than all internodal tissues and leaf tissues; however, no significant difference was detected between root and L5 tissue in genotype KQ228. Xylose and glucose contents whilst displaying some significant differences did not show any consistent organ-specific or maturity-based differences within both genotypes, hence the observations were deemed non-significant.\\n\\nTotal lignin content\\n\\nAcid-soluble lignin (ASL) and acid-insoluble lignin (AIL) were determined using the Klason lignin methodology via spectroscopic and gravimetric means, respectively, reported as a percentage of total AIR (Fig.\u00a03d; Additional file 1: Figs. S9, 10; Tables S10, 11). The larger proportion of the total lignin was acid insoluble. The ASL fraction was significantly higher in leaf tissues in comparison to all other tissues. The AIL fraction was significantly lower in immature internodal (TI) tissues, in comparison to all other tissues. However, in the Q208 genotype, the component was not significantly different between TI and MI tissues. Total lignin was significantly lower in immature internodal tissues in comparison to all other tissues in both genotypes.\\n\\nLignin compounds\\n\\nLignin-derived compounds were determined via GC/MS pyrolysis (Fig.\u00a04a\u2013j), whilst hydroxycinnamic acids (HC), p-coumaric and ferulic acid were determined via separate hydrolysis and subsequent HPLC determination (Fig.\u00a04k, l). The compounds originated from the two primary lignin monomers guaiacyl (G) (Fig.\u00a04a\u2013f, h\u2013i), and syringyl (S) (Fig.\u00a04g, j). Monomers in Fig.\u00a04a\u2013j were determined as the % of the total S and G lignin molecules, whilst monomers k and l were reported as a % of AIR. The ratio of S and G lignin was also calculated (Table 2).\\n\\nFig. 4\\n\\nContribution of lignin-derived compounds in the AIR fraction of Saccharum spp. hybrids. Genotype Q208 is demarcated in dark blue, and KQ228 is demarcated in tan. The compounds originate from guaiacyl (G) (a\u2013e, h\u2013i), syringyl (S) (g, j) and hydroxycinnamic acids (HC) (k, l). Note: hydroxycinnamic acids were detected separately via HPLC determination, and are presented as a % of alcohol-insoluble residue (AIR).

The HC lignin component p-coumaric acid was close to fourfold higher in mature internodal tissues (MI and BI) compared with all other tissues, within both genotypes (Fig.\u00a04k). Ferulic acid composition tended to be lower in immature internodal tissues compared to mature internodes (BI and MI). Further significant differences in ferulic acid content were also observed between TI and L1 tissues of both genotypes (Fig.\u00a04l). Syringol levels were significantly higher in mature internodal tissues than both leaf and root samples in both genotypes (Fig.\u00a04g). Significantly more isoeugenol was observed in root tissues in comparison to all internodal and leaf tissues in both genotypes (Fig.\u00a04i). Guaiacol content was significantly higher in immature internodal tissues in comparison to mature internode (MI and BI) and leaf (L1 and L5) tissues (Fig.\u00a04a.) Methoxy-eugenol content was significantly higher in mature internodal tissues (MI and BI) in comparison to the immature internode (TI), although no significant difference was observed between MI and TI tissues in KQ228 genotype (Fig.\u00a04j). Significantly higher 4-ethyl-guaiacol contents were observed in immature internodal tissue vs. mature internodal tissues in both genotypes (Fig.\u00a04d). All other fractions displayed significance in one or both genotypes between some of the tissue types; however, no specific content pattern was observed, hence they were not described as significant. S/G ratios were significantly higher in mature internodal tissues in comparison to all other tissues, except for MI tissue in KQ228 genotype which had ratios similar to that of root, leaf and immature internodal samples (Table 2). For LSD test values of syringyl, guaiacyl and hydroxycinnamic acid values, see Additional file 1: Fig.\u00a0S11, Table S12 for KQ228 genotype, and Additional file 1: Fig.\u00a0S12, Table S13 for Q208 genotype. For LSD test values of S/G ratios, see Additional file 1: Fig.\u00a0S13, Table S14 for KQ228 genotype, and Additional file 1: Fig.\u00a0S14, Table S15 for Q208 genotype.\\n\\nEnzymatic saccharification\\n\\nAll samples were subjected to enzymatic saccharification over a 72\u00a0h period, after which the glucose and xylose released from the cell wall during saccharification were determined via HPLC. The percentage of released xylose and glucose from the available cell wall fraction was determined (Fig.\u00a05 and Additional file 1: Figs. S15, 16; Tables S16 and 17). The amount of glucose released from the cellulose and \u03b2-glucan fraction was significantly higher in the TI fraction, in comparison to all other tissues in both genotypes. Further, the MI tissue in KQ228 had significantly higher glucose release than L1, L5 and R tissues. Xylose release from the hemicellulose fraction was also significantly higher in TI internodal tissues in comparison to all tissues across both genotypes, except for MI tissue in genotype KQ228. All internodal tissues had significantly higher xylose release than both leaf tissues in both genotypes, except for MI tissue in Q208 genotype.\\n\\nFig. 5\\n\\nGlucan and xylan conversion after 72\u00a0h of enzymatic digestion of the AIR fraction Saccharum spp. hybrids.

Significance was calculated via one-way ANOVA, with the post hoc LSD test to separate statistically dissimilar groups. Statistical analysis was measured separately within each genotype\\n\\nFull size image\\nRegression/correlation analysis\\n\\nThe release of sugars (xylose and glucose) from the AIR (insoluble fraction) was compared to the levels of the insoluble components present using regression and Pearson correlation model calculations across all calculated tissues and biological replicates (Tables 3, 4). Based on the calculated regression and Pearson correlation values, the presence of lignin, particularly the AIL fraction, had the highest negative correlation (\u2212\u20090.67) with glucose release, closely followed by total lignin (\u2212\u20090.66). There was no significant correlation with the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions. Within the hemicellulose fraction, MLG content had a moderate significant positive Pearson correlation with total glucose release (0.43), whereas arabinose (\u2212\u20090.41) and galactose (\u2212\u20090.45) content had a significant negative correlation with total glucose release. Within the lignin fraction, ethyl-2-phenol has a strong positive correlation (0.52), and isoeugenol had a moderate negative correlation with glucose release (\u2212\u20090.43). Xylose release also had a high negative Pearson correlation with total lignin content (\u2212\u20090.65), particularly the ASL fraction (\u2212\u20090.7). Within the lignin fraction, 4-vinyl-guaiacol (\u2212\u20090.39) and isoeugenol (\u2212\u20090.38) had moderate significant negative Pearson correlations with xylose release. There were also lignin components that had a moderate positive correlation with xylose, and this included ethyl-2-phenol (0.41) and isovanillic acid (0.34). Within the hemicellulose fraction, arabinose (\u2212\u20090.57) and galactose (\u2212\u20090.5) content had a strong negative Pearson correlation with glucose release. Also, within the hemicellulose fraction, the MLG fraction had a low to moderate positive Pearson correlation with xylose release (0.35).\\n\\nTable 4 Correlation of cell wall component vs. xylose released from the cell wall during enzymatic saccharification\\nFull size table\\nDiscussion\\n\\nCommercially, the soluble fraction (in the form of sucrose) of sugarcane is utilised in commercial sugar production, whereas the insoluble fibre fraction can be used in several other processes, including electricity co-generation, biofuels, and a variety of biomaterials [2, 40]. In the past decade, utilisation of the insoluble fraction of sugarcane is seen as an ideal feedstock to produce energy products, polymers and non-fossil-based chemicals together within a biorefinery system [9, 41]. Creating more sugarcane fibre that is easier to break down will be key to producing a viable biomaterials sector in the sugarcane industry [9]. Due to the economic importance of the sugarcane culm, the composition of individual internodes has been well characterised between varying levels of maturity and between genotypes [16, 25, 30,31,32,33]. The composition in the other important organs of commercial sugarcane, i.e. roots and leaves, has not been characterised to the same extent as internodal tissues. This limits our understanding of compositional differences between different parts of the sugarcane plant, which in terms of total biomass produced are proportional to the culm [34]. Differences in composition between the major organs of sugarcane may have implications regarding their use in specific biorefinery applications. Significant difference was observed between the different sugarcane organ types within the various insoluble and soluble attributes, as summarised in Fig.\u00a06.\\n\\nFig. 6\\n\\nMajor components of sugarcane biomass that differed significantly between sugarcane tissue types, as determined in this study. Blue indicates there was no significant difference between leaf, internode and root tissues. Red indicates significant differences between the tissues (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05)\\n\\nFull size image\\nInternodes\\n\\nComposition of soluble and insoluble fractions varied greatly between immature and mature internodes. MI and BI tissues did not differ significantly in their ratios of soluble and insoluble components. This result was expected, as MI tissue (internodes 11,12 and 13) is fully mature, and hence the high levels of sucrose [25, 28]. Although the total soluble sugar content was similar between immature (TI) and mature internodes (MI and BI), hexoses dominated in the immature tissue and sucrose in the mature tissue, as has been previously described [23, 29, 42]. The dichotomy of soluble sugar content between immature and mature internodes is indicative of the differences in C utilisation within these tissues. Within the immature internodes, heightened fructose and glucose levels indicate an increase in hydrolysis and cleavage of sucrose, indicative of a meristematic sink [43]. The significantly higher \u201cother\u201d fraction and lower ASL and AIL lignin (in AIR) determined in the immature internodes, in comparison to mature internodes is also supportive of this, as a large amount of C moves into protein and cell wall fractions, which is supportive of results in previous studies [25, 33]. Conversely, the lower comparative hexose content in mature internodes displays the bias of C partitioning away from respiration, cell wall and protein, to that of sucrose storage, as has been described in a previous study [16].\\n\\nInterestingly, the ratio of S/G lignin and the HC lignin compound p-coumaric acid was significantly higher in mature internodes. This result suggests that the deposition of S and HC lignin compounds is prevalent in the latter stages of internodal maturation. The difference in S/G ratio between the rind and pith in [44] is similar to the difference in S/G ratio between mature internodal tissues, and mature leaf and root tissues in this study. The biggest differences in the lignin composition were that of the hydroxycinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid, within mature internodal tissues. The domination of p-coumaric acid over the other common hydroxycinnamic acid, ferulic acid, is characteristic of sugarcane internodal tissues [45, 46]. It has been suggested the p-coumaric acid fraction is esterified to arabinoxylans in small amounts during the early stages of tissue development, then, later on, is esterified more extensively into the lignin fraction [47, 48], as reviewed by [49].\\n\\nThe results from this study and data presented in other studies support the notion that C flow into the three major cell wall fractions is highly stable between different organs or cell types in sugarcane [19, 36, 50]. This lack of difference between the major mature organ types of sugarcane (i.e. MI, BI, R, L1 and L5 tissues), as presented in this study, suggests C partitioning to the cell wall occurs in a fixed ratio (Fig.\u00a04b) regardless of differences in related gene expression, enzymatic activity or metabolic conditions between each organ type during cell wall deposition.\\n\\nLeaves\\n\\nBiomass composition of L1 and L5 tissues did not differ in this study. In comparison to mature internodal tissues, C partitioning in leaf tissues as distinguished by the ratio of insoluble and soluble compounds at DW is characterised by low levels of solubles, high amounts of cell wall compounds and \u2018other\u2019 compounds. Regarding the \u2018other\u2019 compounds, a large degree of this is likely protein, due to the presence of photosynthetic machinery within leaf tissues. Characterisation of protein in sugarcane tops, which is largely made up of photosynthetically active leaves supports this notion, with up to 7% protein found within this tissue [17]. Furthermore, the low amount of soluble sugars in leaf tissues likely indicates the synthesis and transportation of sucrose to sink tissues [51]. Analysis of the cell wall % ratio of the three major cell wall components displayed no difference vs. that of mature internodal tissues. This observation further supports the hypothesis that the ratio of C partitioned into the cell wall fraction is tightly fixed. Alternatively, within the hemicellulose and non-cellulosic fraction, significantly higher levels of arabinose and galactose were observed in leaf tissues vs. internodal tissues, which shows the monomeric makeup of the non-cellulosic fraction to vary between tissues, as has been shown in another study [36].\\n\\nRoots\\n\\nThe low levels of sucrose in sugarcane root tissue display that there is no active C storage, as sucrose, occurring in this tissue. Immature internodal tissue is presumably like root tissue in its utilisation of C, as they both likely assimilate the bulk of C into the cell wall, protein and respiratory pools. The hexose\u2013sucrose profile observed in root tissue (i.e. lower sucrose and higher reducing sugars) was similar to that of immature internodal tissue. However, significantly lower levels of sucrose, fructose and glucose were observed in root tissue in comparison to the immature internodal tissue. This result suggests an enhanced capacity for the root tissue to utilise sucrose and reducing sugars, in comparison to immature internodes. Within immature internodes, a significant portion of sucrose hydrolysis occurs in the vacuole, with up to 95% of reducing sugars being found within [42]. This means metabolism/utilisation of said reducing sugars is restricted by the movement out of the vacuole. The lower reducing sugar content in the root tissue suggests that sucrose hydrolysis does not occur within the vacuole, instead likely occurs within the cytosol or intercellular space, as per [52].\\n\\nWithin the less abundant neutral sugar subunits from the non-cellulosic fraction, significant differences were observed between roots and internodal tissues suggesting differences in mixed-linkage substitution and/or the differential presence of pectins. The high galactose content in the roots compared with the other tissues may display differential pectin deposition between tissues. This is further supported by the significantly higher arabinose contents also found in the root tissues in comparison to mature internodal tissues in this study, which commonly form pectic complexes [19, 53]. As grass cell walls primarily contain arabinoxylans with insignificant amounts of pectic polysaccharides, it could be assumed that most of the arabinose goes into the arabinoxylan fraction. However, the heightened arabinose and galactose content in root tissue may represent the pectin fraction in this tissue, which is not present in internodal tissues. Significantly higher arabinose contents found in leaf tissues in comparison to internodal tissues could also represent this pectic fraction; however, the galactose fraction in most leaf samples was not significantly higher, which could suggest differences in pectic content. It is also possible that the increased arabinose fraction represents an increase in arabinan substitution in both root and leaf tissues [36].\\n\\nEnzymatic saccharification\\n\\nThe effect of biomass composition on recalcitrance in different sugarcane organs was measured by subjecting samples (AIR) to brief autoclaving followed by enzymatic hydrolysis for 72\u00a0h [54]. The rate of saccharification differed greatly between different sugarcane tissue types and between genotypes, suggesting the interaction of several different compositional elements. Based on the regression analysis of the % of released xylose and glucose from saccharification, we obtained cell wall attributes of interest that correlate relatively tightly with recalcitrance. Multiple studies have proposed numerous biomass features that contribute to biomass recalcitrance [19, 20, 33]. Unfortunately, the published literature is often conflicting, and as a result, no clear picture has emerged as to what plant features most strongly limit efficient sugar release [55].\\n\\nTotal lignin was found to have a large negative effect on xylose and glucose release. This finding agrees with current literature, suggesting total lignin content is one of the most important factors in recalcitrance [56,57,58]. In contrast with previous studies [20, 33], no clear correlation was observed between glucan (cellulose\u2009+\u2009MLG) content and glucose release. This may be due to the positive correlation between cellulose and lignin content in these samples. Additionally, differences in biomass pretreatment before enzymatic saccharification, the tissues/organs analysed, and the specific biomass values (i.e. values in AIR, DW or as a molecular ratio) likely contributed to this difference. It should be noted that within the hemicellulose fraction, MLG content was moderately positively correlated with glucose and xylose release, which agrees with the aforementioned studies. Individual S and G lignin monomers were found to have moderate to high correlations with both xylose and glucose release. S and G units amalgamate to form the backbone of the lignin polymer via a labile-aryglycerol-\u03b2-aryl ether (\u03b2-O-4) bond [59]. The strong correlation of individual S and G lignin units was not backed by a highly correlated S/G ratio. The S/G ratio is in many cases highly conflicting as evidenced by the multitude of studies that have found very strong [60,61,62,63] and very weak [57, 63] correlations. However, it is possible that the high variability in monolignol content across tissues affected the correlation in this case. Correlations between individual S and G lignin monolignols and biomass recalcitrance have not yet been investigated in sugarcane. Arabinan and galactan were found to have a clear negative correlation with xylose and glucose release. Arabinose substitution into arabinoxylan complexes is well known to greatly increase biomass recalcitrance [36]. Additionally, hemicellulosic polysaccharides with additional branching are well known to have a significantly higher resistance to saccharification than less decorated polymers [55, 64], which explains the negative correlation between both arabinose and galactose content on xylose release. In individual tissues/organs, the observed higher enzymatic digestibility of immature internodes agrees with a previous study [33]. The aforementioned study referenced the low lignin levels in immature internodes as a core factor in the observed high digestibility. The tendency for higher digestibility in all internodes vs. leaf tissues contradicts a previous study in sugarcane that displayed the opposite trend, albeit in whole internode and whole leaf comparison [20].\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe major organs of sugarcane are distinctly different compositionally. Distinct compositional differences were identified throughout six sugarcane tissues in two commercial genotypes. Overall, the organ-specific analysis presented helps to define the partitioning of carbon into the major soluble and insoluble fractions between the three major sugarcane organs, root, leaf and internodes. Whilst no differences were observed in the ratio of major biomass fractions (hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin) between the root, leaf and mature internodal tissues, clear compositional differences were identified within the monomeric fractions of these traits. This was particularly the case within the hemicellulose and lignin fractions, suggesting differential control of these fractions between each organ type. Enzymatic saccharification analysis revealed the total lignin fraction, arabinose and galactose to be the leading factors in biomass recalcitrance. The results in this multifaceted analysis can be used to inform future genetic studies, and as a potential reference for future genetic manipulation to produce sugarcane genotypes with optimised biomass compositions for a multitude of biofuel and biomaterial applications.\\n\\nMaterials and methods\\nPlant material\\n\\nTissue used in this experiment is derived from two commercial sugarcane varieties, KQ228 and Q208. Sample material was provided by Sugar Research Australia (SRA), which was grown at their station in Brandon, Queensland, Australia. Leaf and internode samples of both genotypes were taken from a 10-month-old commercial stands. Field-grown material contained between 24 and 25 internodes, at an average height of 2.7\u00a0m, from the base of the stem to the top of leaf roll. Root samples of Q208 and KQ228 were obtained from 3-month-old research plants in \u2018soft\u2019 aboveground pots. 3-month-old plants contained nine internodes, at an average height of 50\u00a0cm. All samples were collected in triplicate.\\n\\nSugarcane material collection\\n\\nAll samples were \u2018snap-frozen\u2019 in liquid nitrogen within a minute of excision, put on dry ice in transit and kept in a \u2212\u200980\u00a0\u00b0C freezer before preparation. Root material was taken 20\u00a0cm away from the base of the stem; see Fig.\u00a01. Roots (R) were removed from the pots, washed with a fine mist spray nozzle, and contact dried with a paper towel before snap freezing. Roots were frozen within 30\u00a0s of removal from soil. Leaf material was obtained from the first and fifth leaves with visible dewlaps (L1 and L5, respectively); see Fig.\u00a01. Internodes were numbered following McCormick et al. [43] proposed a schematic. Immature internode (labelled as \u201ctop internode\u201d, TI) material was collected from the second, third and fourth internodes. Mid-range mature internode (labelled as \u201cmiddle internode\u201d, MI) samples were collected from the 11th, 12th and 13th internodes. Bottom-range mature internode (labelled as \u201cbottom internode\u201d, BI) material was collected from the 21st, 22nd and 23rd internodes. Internode samples were taken as small disks 0.5\u00a0cm in height, which were processed into small cubes before snap freezing. Schematic of the tissues sampled is shown in Fig.\u00a01a.\\n\\nSample preparation\\n\\nSamples were prepared based on the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) method (Lyophilisation) in \u201cPreparation of Samples for Compositional Analysis\u201d [65], at the University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD, Australia. Samples were homogenised in cryogenic conditions using a Retsch TissueLyser\u2122 II (Retsch, Haan, Germany) at a frequency of 30/S for 1.5\u00a0min. Following homogenisation, samples were weighed then lyophilised in a VirTis Benchtop\u2122 \u201cK\u201d series freeze dryer (VirTis, Gardiner, NY, USA). The sample weight was recorded after 3\u00a0days in the lyophiliser, then the samples were reweighed after an additional day of lyophilisation to ensure all water was removed from samples. The sample material was weighed before and after freeze-drying to determine the water content. The freeze-dried samples were sent via FedEx International Priority to the facilities at the Joint Bioenergy Institute (JBEI), Emeryville, CA, USA.\\n\\nAlcohol-insoluble residue (AIR) preparation and de-starching\\n\\nAIR was prepared using a modified method described in [66]. Due to the high sugar content of some of the sugarcane samples, particularly the bottom and middle internodes, the AIR preparation protocol was extended to ensure no soluble sugars were retained. The extended protocol was as follows: 300\u00a0mg of pre-dried tissue was added to a 50\u00a0mL Falcon tube, followed by the addition of 40\u00a0mL of 100% (v/v) ethanol. The AIR/ethanol solution was mixed using a Fisher Scientific Vortex-Genie 2\u2122 (Fisher Scientific, New Hampshire, USA) for 30\u00a0s. The solution was then centrifuged in an Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810R\u2122 (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 4000g, at room temperature (RT) for 15\u00a0min. Following centrifugation of 2\u00a0mL of the ethanol, extractive supernatant was collected and put into a separate labelled 50\u00a0mL Falcon tube, the remaining ethanol supernatant was discarded. The previous steps were repeated with the following washes (in order): methanol:chloroform (2v:3v; equal to 16\u00a0mL of methanol and 24\u00a0mL of chloroform), methanol:chloroform (same volumes as 1st wash), 100% ethanol, 65% ethanol, 80% ethanol, 80% ethanol, 100% ethanol and 100% ethanol. An 18\u00a0mL aliquot of alcohol extractives solutions was retained for soluble sugar analysis. Following the final ethanol wash, the resulting AIR was de-starched, using consecutive enzyme incubations of thermostable \u03b1-amylase and an amyloglucosidase and pullulanase mixture, respectively, in 45\u00a0mL of 10\u00a0mm potassium phosphate buffer. All enzymes were added to the AIR/buffer solution at a rate of 1 enzymatic unit/mL. Further details of the de-starching method are outlined in [67]. Starch, as a polymer of glucose, can disrupt the accuracy of downstream cell wall analysis, disrupting the accuracy of the hydrolysed glucose yield from hemicellulose and cellulose [68]. Following de-starching, samples were lyophilised over 2\u00a0days in a Virtis\u2122 benchtop freeze drier, until a stable weight was obtained.\\n\\nHigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of AIR\\n\\nA 2\u00a0mL aliquot of the 18\u00a0mL ethanol extractives supernatant derived from the AIR preparation protocol was dried down under nitrogen (N) gas in a Techne Sample Concentrator (Techne, Charleston, SC, USA). The extractives precipitate was resuspended in 200\u00b5L of Milli-Q\u00ae water (18.2 \u03a9), filtered through a 0.45\u00a0\u00b5m filter plate, and then loaded into the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. The samples were run on an Agilent 1260 Infinity\u2122 LC series system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), with a Bio-Rad 300\u2009\u00d7\u20097.8\u00a0mm Aminex 87 H column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and a Bio-Rad cation H guard column. The Agilent 1260 refractive index detector (RID) was held at 35\u00a0\u00b0C. The samples were run using an isocratic 4\u00a0mM sulphuric acid eluent at 0.6\u00a0mL/min\u22121 and 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 16\u00a0min. For the quantification of sucrose, glucose, and fructose, the conditions using a temperature of 18\u00a0\u00b0C and 10\u00a0mM sulphuric acid eluent at a flow rate of 0.3\u00a0mL/min\u22121 for 22\u00a0min. The extractive precipitate sample volume was 3\u00b5L (at RT). A combined sucrose, fructose and glucose standard from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MI, USA) at concentrations of 5, 10, and 20\u00a0g/L was run as a signature reference, which displayed satisfactory accuracy of the HPLC instrument. For further details of the methods and instruments utilised, see [69].\\n\\nDetermination of hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin and insoluble ash in AIR\\n\\nBasic compositional analysis of AIR was conducted for the major lignocellulosic components cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and ash, using NREL methods, altered for sugarcane fibre [66]. 100\u00a0mg of AIR underwent acid hydrolysis using 1\u00a0mL of 72% sulphuric acid (H2SO4), subjected to a 1\u00a0h incubation at 30\u00a0\u00b0C. Following incubation, the sulphuric acid (SA) was diluted to 4% with Milli-Q\u00ae water (18.2\u00a0\u03a9), then autoclaved for 1\u00a0h at 121\u00a0\u00b0C. Cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysate analysis in HPLC was undertaken using the SA hydrolysate supernatant following autoclaving. A 2\u00a0mL aliquot of the diluted sulphuric acid supernatant was dried down using N gas, resuspended in 200 \u00b5L of milli-Q water and filtered through 0.45\u00a0\u00b5m filter. SA supernatant was run on an Agilent 1260 Infinity\u2122 LC series HPLC system, through a Bio-Rad 7.8\u00a0mm x 300\u00a0mm Aminex 87H column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), with a Bio-Rad cation H guard column. The Agilent 1260 refractive index detector (RID) was held at 35\u00a0\u00b0C. The samples were run using an isocratic 4\u00a0mM sulphuric acid eluent at 0.6\u00a0mL/min\u22121 and 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 16\u00a0min. Sugar calibration standards were prepared and diluted to create six-point calibration curve, 0.0156\u20142.0\u00a0mg/mL for xylose and 0.03125\u20134.0\u00a0mg/mL for glucose, and 0.325\u201320\u00a0mg/mL for glucose. For further details regarding methods and instruments utilised, see [70]. Acid-soluble lignin (ASL) was determined using a 2\u00a0\u00b5L aliquot of the filtered supernatant solution, on a Thermo Scientific NanoDrop\u2122 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) UV\u2013visible spectrometer, at 320\u00a0nm. The remaining dilute SA supernatant was filtered through a 25\u00a0mL vacuum crucible (CoorsTek #60,531) and then dry crucibles (in oven) at 105\u00a0\u00b0C for a minimum of 6\u00a0h. Crucibles were weighed before and after SA supernatant filtration (weighed after oven drying) to calculate the % total of ASL, hemicellulose and cellulose. Following weighing, the crucibles were placed in a Themolyne\u2122 industrial benchtop furnace (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a 575\u00a0\u00b0C cycle for 6\u00a0h. Crucibles were weighed following pyrolysis.\\n\\nNon-cellulosic monosaccharide content determination via TFA hydrolysis\\n\\nGlucose is a product of both cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysis. To determine the contribution of both polysaccharide groups to hydrolytic glucose, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) hydrolysis followed by Saeman hydrolysis was employed, optimised for sugarcane from [71]. The TFA hydrolysis method is as follows: 1\u00a0mg of AIR was resuspended in 1\u00a0mL of Milli-Q\u00ae water (18.2\u00a0\u03a9), then a 50\u00a0\u00b5L aliquot was taken for downstream analysis, in a 1.5\u00a0mL screw cap tube. The 50\u00a0\u00b5L aliquot was then dried down in an Eppendorf Vacufuge\u00ae plus at the following settings: 1\u00a0h, 45\u00a0\u00b0C, V, AQ setting. Following drying, 400\u00a0\u00b5L of 2\u00a0M TFA was added to the dried material, then incubated at 120\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h in a Techne Dri-Block\u00ae DB-3D. The TFA solution was then centrifuged in an Eppendorf Centrifuge 5418D, at the following settings 4\u00a0\u00b0C, 10 mins, and 14000g (max RPM). The supernatant was removed from the solution and retained in a new 1.5\u00a0mL tube. The remaining crystalline pellet was washed with 400\u00a0\u00b5L of Milli-Q\u00ae water (18.2 \u03a9), vortexed for 30\u00a0s, and then centrifuged (using the same settings as above). The supernatant was removed from the milli-q/pellet solution, then pooled with the TFA supernatant. The remaining crystalline cellulose pellet was then dried down in the Vacufuge at the following settings: 1\u00a0h, 45\u00a0\u00b0C, V, AQ setting. The dried crystalline cellulose pellet was retained for Saeman hydrolysis, for glucose determination via HPLC. The combined TFA/Milli-Q supernatant was also dried down at the following settings: RT, \u221e time, V, AQ. Following drying, the supernatant precipitate was resuspended in 200\u00a0\u00b5L of Milli-Q\u00ae water (18.2\u00a0\u03a9). 150\u00a0\u00b5L of the resuspension was filtered (0.45\u00a0\u00b5m) then run on a Dionex\u2122 ICS-5000+ SP (Thermo-Scientific, Dionex, Sunnyvale, California USA) high-performance anion-exchange chromatograph with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD). A CarboPac PA20 analytical anion exchange column (3\u00a0mm x 150\u00a0mm; Thermo Fisher Scientific), PA20 guard column (3\u00a0mm x 30\u00a0mm), and a borate trap was utilised within the HPAEC. Proceeding a 5\u00a0min equilibration, the injected sample was eluted using an isocratic gradient of 4\u00a0mM NaOH from 0 to 6\u00a0min, followed by a linear gradient of 4\u00a0mM NaOH to 1\u00a0mM NaOH from 6 to 19\u00a0min. At 19.1\u00a0min, the gradient was increased to 450\u00a0mM NaOH to elute the acidic sugars. HPAEC method was based on [72]. Equivalent sugar standards of glucose, xylose, arabinose, galactose, mannose, fucose and rhamnose were utilised.\\n\\nDetermination of hydroxycinnamic acids\\n\\n30\u00a0mg of AIR was used to determine the ferulic and p-coumaric acid content. The AIR was added to a 1.2\u00a0mL tube and then suspended in 500\u00a0\u00b5L of 2\u00a0M NaOH. The NaOH suspension was incubated for 24\u00a0h at 30\u00a0\u00b0C. Following incubation, the NaOH solution was neutralised to a pH of 2 using 100\u00a0\u00b5L of 12.39\u00a0M hydrochloric acid (HCl) (Sigma Aldrich), after which 500\u00a0\u00b5L of ethyl acetate was added. The solution was vortexed (Vortex-Genie 2\u2122) for 30\u00a0s and then centrifuged (Eppendorf 5810R) for 5\u00a0min at g\u2009\u00d7\u20094000. After centrifugation, the separated top layer of the supernatant was transferred to a new 1.2\u00a0mL tube. The ethyl acetate wash was completed two more times (the top layers from the 3 ethyl acetate washes were combined). The top layer supernatant was then dried down under N gas (Techne Sample Concentrator) and then resuspended using 200\u00a0\u00b5L in acetonitrile (vortexed for 30\u00a0s). Before injection into the HPLC instrument, the solution was filtered (0.45\u00a0\u00b5m). Standards for coumaric and ferulic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) (CAS No. 501-98-4 & 537\u201398-4) at 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.12, and 0.0625\u00a0g/L were used as reference. HPLC separation of lignin-derived aromatics (coumaric acid and ferulic acid) was performed on a C18 column (Agilent Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18) using acetonitrile\u2013water (20:80, containing 0.5% acetic acid) eluent at 1\u00a0mL/min and 25\u00a0\u00b0C for 12\u00a0min. Diode array detection (DAD) was performed at 310 and 320\u00a0nm.\\n\\nGC/MS pyrolysis\\n\\nAIR pyrolysis in conjunction with gas chromatography\u2013mass spectroscopy (GC\u2013MS) was utilised to semi-quantitatively compare the amount of S and G lignin molecules within each sample. Methods were completed as described in [73]. The samples were pyrolyzed at 550\u00a0\u00b0C using a CDS analytical Pyrophobe 5200\u2122 (CDS Analytical Inc. Oxford, PA, US) connected to an Agilent 6890 GC\u2013MS system. The GC\u2013MS systems were equipped with a Thermo Electron Trace gas chromatograph (GC) Ultra and Polaris-Q mass spectrometer (MS) (Thermo Electron Corp, Waltham, MA, US) equipped with a TR-SMS column (60\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u20090.25\u00a0mm) operated in the split mode (40\u00a0mL/min\u22121) using helium (He) as a carrier. The GC was set as per the following: initial temperature of 50\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min, then increased by 5\u00a0\u00b0C increments per min to 300\u00a0\u00b0C, which was held for 5\u00a0min. Organic compounds were identified based on their mass spectra and GC retention time using the NIST spectroscopy data centre (NIST08). S and G molecules were identified based on their specific m/z value (mass/ion charge no.) and quantified as a percentage of the Pyrogram. Relative amounts of S and G molecules were presented as a percentage of the Pyrogram, hence making the calculation semi-quantitative [74]. Specific pyrolysis fragments, their elution time and their origin are listed in Table 5. S/G ratio was calculated as the sum of all peak areas of S molecules divided by the total peak areas of G molecules.\\n\\nTable 5 Compounds found by Pyro GC/MS with elution time and their origin\\nFull size table\\nEnzymatic saccharification\\n\\nThe differing compositional attributes of organs within sugarcane contribute to differences in susceptibility to enzymatic saccharification. The effect of biomass composition on recalcitrance in different sugarcane organs was measured by subjecting samples (AIR) to brief autoclaving, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis for 72\u00a0h. Methods were based on a modified protocol outlined in [75]. Saccharification was undertaken with two separate enzymatic mixes with high hemicellulasic and cellulasic qualities: Novozyme Cellic\u00ae CTec2:HTec2 (Novozymes, Bagsv\u00e6rd, Copenhagen, Denmark). Xylose and glucose released from the AIR fraction was quantified using HPLC, as previously described. Details of enzymatic dilutions, solution concentrations and total solution size used in the enzymatic saccharification are described in Table 6.\\n\\nTable 6 Details of enzymatic dilutions, solution concentrations and total solution size, used in the enzymatic saccharification\\nFull size table\\nData processing\\n\\nAll data analysis and illustration were done using XLSTAT ver 2017.7 in Microsoft Excel 2016, RStudio ver 1.1.383 [76] in R ver 3.4.3 [77], and IBM\u00ae SPSS\u00ae statistics ver. 23 [78]. The statistical significance of the mean of the biological replicates was calculated utilising the one-way ANOVA function, with the additional least significant difference (LSD) post hoc test, within SPSS. The null hypothesis was accepted at a p value of\u2009\u2264\u20090.05. Minimum and maximum outliers (two-sided) were removed from some datasets using the modified Thompson Tau test [79]. Regression analysis was undertaken using the dot plotting function in SPSS with the R2 calculated, to define the best correlations between glucose and xylose release from the cell wall structure and biomass traits, as is commonly used in biomass determination studies [80,81,82]. The significance of the regression values was calculated using the bivariate correlation function in SPSS.\\n\\nAvailability of data and materials\\n\\nThe datasets supporting the conclusions of this article are included in the article and its Additional file 1.\\n\\nAbbreviations\\nC:\\n\\nCarbon\\n\\nS:\\n\\nSyringyl lignin\\n\\nG:\\n\\nGuaiacyl lignin\\n\\nHC:\\n\\nHydroxycinnamic acids\\n\\nS/G ratio:\\n\\nSyringyl\u2013guaiacyl ratio\\n\\nSuSy:\\n\\nSucrose synthase\\n\\nSPS:\\n\\nSucrose phosphate synthase\\n\\nBI:\\n\\nBottom internode range\\n\\nMI:\\n\\nMiddle internode range\\n\\nTI:\\n\\nTop Internode range\\n\\nL1:\\n\\nFirst visible dewlap leaf\\n\\nL5:\\n\\nFifth visible dewlap leaf\\n\\nR:\\n\\nRoot\\n\\nDW:\\n\\nDry weight\\n\\nAIR:\\n\\nAlcohol insoluble residue (extractives free)\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n(ICE) IE: Sugar No. 11 Futures.

        "text_abstract": "This study investigates the variation in biomass composition of sugarcane, focusing on the distinct parts of the plant\u2014mature and immature internodes, roots, and mature leaves\u2014and their enzymatic saccharification efficiency. Differences in the composition of sugar, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin across these different plant parts were characterized, revealing tissue-specific partitioning of carbon within the sugarcane plant. The implications for using such biomass as feedstock in biorefinery systems are discussed, highlighting how these compositional differences could affect processing efficiency.",
        "text_novelty": "The research provides a detailed analysis of the compositional differences across various parts of the sugarcane plant, marking a substantial advancement in understanding sugarcane's biomass composition. Unlike previous studies which might have generalized sugarcane biomass composition, this work delineates the specific variations present in leaves, internodes, and roots, providing clear evidence of differential carbon partitioning. Furthermore, it examines the implications of these differences on the biomass's recalcitrance to enzymatic saccharification, a pioneering approach toward optimizing the crop for biorefinery applications.",

Ingram, ingram@ufl.edu  \n  2 \n Abstract  \n \nSwitchgrass (Alamo) was pretreated with phosphoric acid (0.75 and 1%, w/w) at three \ntemperatures (160, 175 and 190 \u00b0C) and time (5, 7.5 and 10 min) using a steam gun. The slurry \nafter pretreatment was liquefied by enzymes and the released sugars were ferme nted in a \nsimultaneous saccharification and co -fermentation process to ethanol using ethanologenic \nEscherichia coli  strain SL100. Among the three variables in pretreatment , temperature and time \nwere critical in supporting ethanol titer and yield. Enzyme hy drolysis significantly increased the \nconcentration of furans in slurries, apparently due to release of furans bound to the solids. The \nhighest ethanol titer of 21.2\u00b10.3 g /L ethanol obtained at the pretreatment condition of 190 -1-7.5 \n(temperature -acid conce ntration -time) and 10% solids loading account ed for 190\u00b12.9 g ethanol  \n/kg of raw switch grass . This converts to  61.7 gallons of ethanol per ton of dry switchgrass , a \nvalue that is comparable to other published pretreatment conditions . \n \n \nKeywords : Switchgrass; Fermentation; phosphoric acid pretreatment; ethanol; L+SScF   3 \n 1.  Introduction  \nWorld consumption of petroleum in 201 6 was 9 7 million barrels per day and this is projected to \nincreas e at about 1.5% per year (US Energy Information Administratio n; EIA ). Even with new \ndiscovery of oil reservoirs, world economy is still dependent on limited number of fossil fuels \nexporting countries. Although several non -petroleum energy sources are available, transportation \nstill depends on liquid fuels derived from petro leum. In 2016 , 88% of transportation energy in \nU.S.A. was derived from petroleum and this is about 70% of the total petroleum consumption  in \nthe country (EIA) . Gasoline accounted for 55% of the total energy used by the transportation \nsector in U.S.A . and s upplementation of gasoline with renewable ethanol is expected to lower \nthis demand on petroleum . Due to c oncerns of climate change, energy independence, f inite \nnature of oil, as well as economic security of the nation , developing sustainable sources of \nenergy and products have become an immediate objective of several countries, including U.S.A. \nRenewable energy derived from biomass is  a substitute for fossil -based liquid transportation  fuel. \nBiomass includes  all photosynthetic material s and can be converted  to fuels, chemicals or power.  \nAlthough petroleum is also derived  from biomass , fixation of CO 2 from the atmosphere to \nproduce this biomass and its utilization as fuel today are separated by millions of years. This \ntime differential in production of biomass and consumption of petroleum is the leading cause of \ncurrent environmental concerns . By coupli ng production and consumption of biomass, a \nsustainable cyclic process with minimal environmental impact can be developed.  \nEthanol is a liquid fuel produced by fermentation of sugars (sugarcane or sugar beet) or \nstarch in grain s of cereal crops. Due to its  relatively high octane number and high heat of \nvaporization , ethanol can be readily  blend ed with gasoline  (Hahn -Hagerdal et al., 2006) . In \nU.S.A ., corn is the dominant commercial feedstock of the ethanol industry that produces about 4 \n 16 billion gallons per year (EIA) . As a food crop, grains used for ethanol produ ction competes \nwith its primary use as food and feed  (Zilberman et al., 2013) . In addition, fertile land is removed \nfrom food production for fuel production  (Seyffarth, 2016) . To overcome these limitations and to \nexpand biofuel production  to lower petroleum consumption , research is focused on \nlignocellulosic materials  as feedsto ck for bio fuel production in a sustainable way (Energy -EERE, \n2015; Lynd et al., 2017) . Energy crops grown in marginal lands appeal as additional  sources of \nbiomass for biofuel production and switchgrass, a native plant of North America, appears to be \nthe most promising herbaceous energy crop (Keshwani & Cheng, 2009; Wright & Turhollow, \n2010) . \nLignocellulosic biomass contains sugars in  the form of cellulose and hemicellulose  that \nare embedded with lignin in a structurally rigid form  (Fengel &  Wegener, 1983) . Their natural \nfunction to bear high mechanical loads  and resist chemical and enzymatic degradation  is not \ncompatible with its proposed use as feedstock for fuel production. Since industrially important \nmicroorganisms require monomeric s ugars or oligosaccharides (2 -4 sugar moieties) as feedstock \nfor fermentation  to ethanol , the polysaccharides in the plant tissue need to be destabilized and \nconverted to constituent sugars.  Several pretreatment strategies  have been described to disrupt  \nthe biomass structure to generate sugar monomers  (Tao et al., 2011) . Dilute acid at high \ntemperature is one of the methods that effectively hydrolyzes hemicellulose while also rendering \ncellulose to enzyme hydrolysis  (Yang & Wyman, 2009) . Sulfuric acid , due to its low cost , is an \nintensely studied catalyst  for biomass pretreatment , although this process requires complex \nalloys to minimize corrosion of equipment in a biorefinery. Rel atively milder phosphoric acid  as \na catalyst for biomass pretreatment not only lowers the cost of equipment but also reduces the \namount of inhibitory compounds generated during pretreatment (Fontana et al., 1984; Geddes et 5 \n al., 2010) . Presence of inhibitors in the pretreatment slurry demand additional process steps to \nremove the inhibitors or microbial biocatalyst s that can metabolically convert the inhibitors to \nless inhibitory  form before growth and fermentation.    \nA phosphoric acid based one pot fermentation process was developed and successfully \nevaluated using sugar cane and sorghum bagasses (Geddes et al., 2013) . This process utilized the \nentire slurry (solids and hydrolysate) from  pretreatment and after enzyme hydrolysis and SScF \n(L+SScF) with Escherichia  coli strain SL100 yielded an average of  275 g ethanol per kg of dry \nbagasse  (about 76% yield) . Phosphoric acid has also been used for pretreatment of corn stover  \nand corn cob  (Avci et al., 2013a; Satimanont et al., 2012) . Under conditions that are optimized \nfor each pretreatment of corn stover, the yield of ethanol from a phosphoric acid process was 26 \ng/L at 10% loading and this was not dissimilar  to 30 g/L ethanol (300 g/kg of stover) yield from \na sulfuric acid pretreatment process (Avci et al., 2013a; Avci et al., 2013b) . These studies show \nthat phosphoric acid pretreatment of biomass followed by appropriate amount of enzymes can \nsupport  ethanol yields that are comparable to other pretreatment strategies  (Geddes et al., 2011) . \nAn additional advantage of phosphoric acid pretreatment is that the residual acid in the slurry can \nserve as phosphate for growth of the fermenting microo rganism. Residual  phosphorus in the \nstillage can be recovered and used as a fertilizer for plant growth (Geddes et al., 2013; de \nVasconcelos et al., 2013 ). In addition to being a microbial and plant nutrient, a dilute phosphoric \nacid and steam pretreatment eliminates the need for solvent recovery steps that are needed in \nother pretreatment s, such as , organosolv. With appropriate equipment, the pretreatment time and \ntemperature can be lower with phosphoric acid pretreatment compared to autohydrol ysis of \nbiomass (Kim et al., 2011) . These characteristics, along with lower inhibitor concentration in th e \nslurry from the phosphoric acid and steam pretreatment compared to sulfuric acid pretreatment 6 \n (Geddes et al., 2010) , support direc t utilization of the slurry  in a biorefinery  for fermentation to \nethanol with enzyme hydrolysis  but without expensive separation and/or detoxification \nprocesses . This simple process is anticipated to lower both equipment and process costs in the \nbiorefinery.  \nVarious pretreatment strategie s for swi tchgrass have been reported and t hese include \nsulfuric acid/steam, ammonia, base, ionic liquids, etc. (Kim et al., 2011; Papa et al., 2015) . Many \nof these pretreatment s are followed by additional steps of separation of solids  and liquids , \nremoval of the chemicals used in pretreatment, etc.  In this study, a phosphoric acid based \npretreatment of switchgrass modeled after a simplified process developed for sugar  cane bagasse  \n(Geddes et al., 2013)  is described . This process from biomass to ethanol contains only  three \nsteps; pretreatment with acid and steam, liquefaction with enzymes and SScF with ethanologenic \nE. coli  strain SL100. This is the first phosphoric acid based simplified process for switchgrass as \na feedstock for production of ethanol that yielded about 190 g ethanol per kg of dry biomass.  \n \n2. Materials and Methods  \n2.1 Materials  \nSwitchgrass (Alamo) ( Panicum virgatum  L) grown in Virginia, USA was harvested in Fall 2015 , \nsize reduced to about 1 inch,  and donated by Mr. Fred Circle (FDC enterprises, Inc.) for this \nstudy. The biomass with a dry weight of 89.28\u00b10.57% was stored in sacks at room temperature \nin the UF Stan Mayfield Biorefinery. Enzyme Cellic CTec3 (230 FPU per ml) was provided by \nNovozymes  (Franklinton, NC ). Phosphoric acid, potassium hydroxide and other chemicals were \nfrom Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA).  \n2.2 Composition Analysis  7 \n Composition of samples of raw switchgrass, biomass solids obtained after pretreatment and \nfermentation w as determined  using a method developed by t he U.S. National Renewable Energy \nLaboratory (NREL method) (Sluiter et al., 2012) .  \n2.3 Pretreatment  \nTwenty kg of r aw switchgrass in 4 kg (dry weight ) batches were soaked in 56 kg of phosphoric \nacid solution at various concentrations (0, 0.75%, 1.0%; w /w) for 12 hours at room temperature. \nPhosphoric acid  was based on the amount mixed with water prior to adding switchgr ass and \ncompensated for moisture in the biomass. Soaked switchgrass was dewatered using a CP -4 screw \npress (Vincent Corporation, Tampa, FL) to 30 -50% dry weight. Phosphoric acid impregnated  \nand dewatered  biomass samples were combined, mixed , and separated into 500 g samples (dry \nweight) for steam treatment  as described previously (Geddes et al., 2011; Palmqvist et al., 1996) . \nThe 500 g sample upon entry into the 10 L pressure chamber was rapidly heated by high pressure \nsteam to the needed temperature (160, 175, 180, and 190  \u00b0C) and  held for the required time (5, \n7.5 and 10 min ). The time required to reach  190\u00b0C in the chamber was about 15 seconds while \noperating temperatures that are less than 190\u00b0C was reached in less than 5 seconds. At the end of \npretreatment, the slurry was rapidly discharged into a bin at atmospheric pressure  and room \ntemperature  (\u226410 seconds). A total of 20 kg of switchgrass was processed under each \npretreatment condition in several batches. Pretreated biomass samples (slurry) from all the \nbatches were pooled, mixed and stored at 4\u00b0C.  \n2.4 Characterization of the p retreated switchgrass  \nFor deter mination of water insoluble solid (WIS), 5g of pretreated biomass slurry was washed \nwith 4L of deionized water using a Whatman Qualitative Filter Paper at a pore size 2 .5 \u03bcm under 8 \n vacuum  to remove all the solubles, including free sugars and inhibitors . The solid residue was \ndried to constant weight  before analysis .  \nFor determination of the composition of the hydrolysate, about  10-15 g of pretreated \nbiomass slurry was pressed with RA Chand J210 manual citrus juicer. The pass -through was \ncentr ifuged for 12 minutes at 600 x g and the  supernatant (hydrolysate) was used for \ndetermination of pH, density, conductivity, dry weight and composition of the hydrolysate.  \nTo determine the composition of the slurry, a sample was dried at 60\u00b0C to constant \nweight. The dried sample was cut and passed through a sieve with 0.841 mm opening  before \nanalysis .  \n2.5 Liquefaction of the  Slurry  \nCommercial cellulase (Cellic CTec3 ; 230 FPU/ml ) was added at the desired concentration to a \nwell-mixed sample of slurry (10% solids, w/v) at pH 5.0 (adjusted with NH 4OH) and the \ncarbohydrates were  partially saccharified ( liquefied ) with 11.5 FPU/g dry biomass at 50\u00b0C for 6 \nh at the optimum temperature and pH  for the enzymes  (Application Sheet for Cellic CTec3 from \nNovozymes) , as before for sugar  cane bagasse slurry (Geddes et al., 2011)  to improve mixing of \nthe slurry .  \n2.6 Detoxification of Pretreated Slurry  \nThe slurry from 190-1-7.5 pretreatment condition was not fermented by E. coli  strain SL100 \nwhen the solids concentration was increased to 15% due to a concomitant increase in inhibitors. \nThe slurry from this pretreatment condition was detoxified to remove some of the inhibitory \ncompounds  to aid growth and fermentation of strain SL100 . For detoxification , pH of the slurry \nwas adjusted to 9.0 with NH 4OH and incubated for 12 hours at 4 \u00b0C as described previously 9 \n (Geddes et al., 2013) . During this incubation period, pH of the sample decreased to about 7.0 . \nThis slurry was used as detoxified material for L+SScF to ethanol.    \n2.7 Microbial biocatalyst and growth conditions  \nEthanologenic E. coli  strain SL100 with higher level of tolerance to inhibitors in sugar cane \nbagasse hydrolysate  was described previously (Geddes et al., 2013) . Strain SL100 can grow and \nferment in mineral salts  medium containing up to 50% of sugar cane bagass e hydrolysate (about \n1.0 g/L of furfural). The growth medium used was mineral salts medium AM1 (Martinez et al., \n2007) . Seed cultures for SScF were grown in AM1 medium with 60% switchgrass hydrolysate \nfrom a pretreatment con dition of 180 -1-10 (filtered and filter sterilized) for 20 hours at 37\u00b0C \nwith 0.01 vvm aeration and pH control at 6.3 with 5N NH 4OH. This hydrolysate medium \ncontain ing 17.6 g/L of total sugars and 0.6 g/L of furans  was used for growing strain SL100 \nsince this allowed adaptation of the ethanologen to switchgrass slurry. After 20 h of growth  to a \ncell dry weight of 1.7 g/L , all the sugars were fermented to an ethanol titer of 4.9 g/L.   \nFermentations were conducted in BioFlo 110 fermenters  (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY ) \nusing a 3L vessel with 2L working volume (37oC, 200 rpm). Liquefied slurry (10% solids  \ncontent ) in AM1 medium at pH 6.3 was supplemented with sodium meta -bisulfite (SMB, 2M) \nbefore inoculation  to lower the t oxicity (Alriksson et al., 2011; Nieves et al., 2011a) . \nFermentations were started with 200 ml of seed culture. Cell density at the start of SScF was \n0.17 g/L . After inoculation , the culture  at 37\u00b0C was aerated at 0.01 vvm (20 ml/min) to increase \nthe growth rate and support  rapid metabolic removal  of inhibitors in the slurry  (Nieves et al., \n2011b) . Fermentation pH was maintained at 6.3 by automatic addition of 5N NH 4OH. Growth of \nthe culture and fermentation profile were monitored for 96 hours. Concentration of sugars, \nethanol and co -products in the medium  were determined and normalized to the starting culture 10 \n volume of 2L after adjustment for volume change due to sample withdrawal and base addition. \nFermentations were conducted in triplicate and the mean and sta ndard deviation were calculated \nfrom the fermentations profiles.  \n2.8 Analytical methods  \nDry weight was determined using a moisture analyzer (Kern model MLB 50 \u20133; Balingen, \nGermany). Hydrolysate composition was determined by HPLC (Agilent Technologies 1260 with \nrefractive index detector ). Sugars were separated using Aminex HPX -87P ion exclusion column \n(300x7.8 mm ; Bio -Rad, Hercules, CA ) fitted with Carbo -Ca 4 guard column (4x3 mm ; \nPhenomenex, Torrance, CA) operating at 80\u00b0C with water as the mobile phase (0.6 ml/min). \nOrganic acids and furans were determined by HPLC (Agilent Technologies 1260 HPLC \nequipped with UV and refractive index  detecters,  in series) with Aminex HPX - 87H column \n(Bio-Rad; 45 \u00b0C; 4 mM H2SO4 as the mobile phase , 0.4 ml/min flow rate). Ethanol was \ndetermined by GC as described before using an Agilent Technologies 6890N gas chromatograph  \n(Geddes, et al., 2010).  \n \n3. Results and Discussion  \nThe Alamo switchgrass  as received had a dry weight of 89%. The switchgrass had a total \ncarbohydrate content of 64% with glucan, xylan and arabinan accounting for 38, 22 and 4 % of \nthe dry weight of the biomass, respectively. This carbohydrate content translates to 716.4 g \nfermentable monomeric s ugars per kg of dry switchgrass that can yield a theoretical amount of \n365 g ethanol per kg of dry biomass. Soluble and insoluble lignin content of switchgrass w as 5 11 \n and 23% , respectively , while the  ash content was 1.6 %. Except for the ash  content, these values \nare comparable to the published values for various switchgrass  cultivars (Hu et al., 2010) .  \n3.1 Pretreatment   \nPhosphoric acid was used as the catalyst for pretreatment of switchgrass with high pressure \nsteam  as described for sugar  cane bagasse (Geddes et al., 2011)  and in the Methods section . \nSlurry obtained after pretreatment contained both fibrous solids and liquid hydrolysate. Total \nsugar s released during pretreatment and present in the hydrolysate varied from 15 to 72 g per kg \nof biomass depending on the condition (Table 1) . A line ar relationship was observed between  \ntemperature (acid concentration , 0.75% ; residence time,  5 min ) and the amount of xylose and \ntotal sugar s released during pretreatment. Similar linear relationship of temperature and total \nsugar release was also reported  for phosphoric acid pretreatment of sugar cane bagasse  (Geddes \net al., 2011) . However, the amount of sugar re leased from sugar cane bagasse was about 3-times \nhigher than from switchgrass  at similar pretreatment condition  suggesting the hardiness of \nswitchgrass compared to sugar cane bagasse. Similar less efficient hydrolysis of switchgrass to \nglucose compared to corn stover was also reported by Serate et al. (Serate et al., 2015) . In \nagreement with this hardiness of switchgrass, Avci, et al. reported that corn stover pretreatment \ncondition of 160 -1-10 (temperature -acid concentration -time) with phosphoric acid hydrolyzed \nabout 95  % of hemicellulose and the total sugar yield after pre treatment was 218.4 g per kg of \ndry corn stover (Avci et al., 2013a) . Compared to a total sugar yield from switchgrass at 160 -1-\n7.5 of only 34 g/kg biomass (Table 1), sugar yiel d from corn stover was about 7 -times higher \nthan from switchgrass. Pretreatment of switchgrass using sulfuric acid (160-0.5-10) as the \ncatalyst  did hydrolyze about 80 -90% of hemicellulose compared to only about 10% of 12 \n hemicellulose hydrolysis during phosph oric acid pretreatment (160-1-7.5) (Table 1) confirming \nthe milder nature of phosphoric acid (Kim et al., 2011) . \nDue to the narrow range of acid concentration and time of pretreatment used in this study , \nselected from  previous studies on sugar cane bagasse (Geddes et al., 2011; Geddes et al., 2010) , \nthese two variables had no significant effect on hydrolysis of carbohydrates . Among the various \npretreatment conditions tested in this study, the highest amount of sugars released was at 190 -1-\n7.5 accounting for about 5 2.8\u00b12.0  g xylose per kg of switchgrass (about 21% of hemicellulose)  \n(Table 1) . The hydrolysate from this pretreatment condition also c ontained about 4 g furfural and \n1.4 g hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) to a total of 5.3 g furans per kg of switchgrass  (Table 2). \nThis is in agreement with  reported positive correlation between pretreatment temperature and \nthe concentration of sugar and inhibitor s in the slurry of  phosphoric acid pretreated sugar  cane \nbagasse (Geddes et al., 2011) . In addition, acetate and formate were also present in the \nhydrolysates.  \n3.2 Solids Content after pretreatment  \nWith these pretreatment conditions, water insoluble solids correspondingly decreased as more \nsugars are released from the biomass , primarily due to hydrolysis of hemicellulos e with xylose as \nthe dominant free sugar. This is also seen as a chan ge in the composition of biomass solids after \npretreatment  (Fig. 1) . In addition to a decrease in hemicellulose, soluble lignin also decreased \nwith increasing severity of pretreatment . These results are similar to decrease in hemicellulose in \nwater insolub le solids  reported with phosphoric acid treated bagasse or sulfuric acid treated \nswitchgrass (Geddes et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2009) .  \n3.3 Liquefaction  13 \n Since the slurry contained both fibrous solids and hydrolysate, it was difficult to mix the slurry \neven at 10% solids loading  for simultaneous saccharification and co -fermentation (SScF) . A \nshort period of cellul ase treatment (6 h) reduced  the average particle size of solids and improved \nmixing of the slurry during SScF  (L+SScF) (Geddes et al., 2013) . In order to establish an \noptimum concentration of Cellic CTec3 for liquefaction and further SScF, slurry from the \npretreatment  condition of 190 -1-7.5 was treated with various enzyme concentrations (3.45 to \n17.25 FPU p er g dry biomass ; 1.5-7.5%, v/w ) for 6 hours at the optimum condition for Cellic \nCTec3  (50\u00b0C; pH 5.0) . The  amount of glucose, xylose and arabinose released during this \nliquefaction step was determined (Fig. 2 ). Glucose concentration in the slurry increased with \nincreasing enzyme concentration until the enzyme activity reached about 11.5 FPU / g dry \nbiomass. Further increase in the enzyme concentration had no significant  effect on cellulose \nhydrolysis to glucose. An enzym e concentration of 11. 5 FPU per g biomass was used to saturate \nhydrolysis of cellulose, the primary carbohydrate in switchgrass . The highest amount of glucose \nreleased during 6 hours of enzyme hydrolysis with 1 1.5 FPU per g biomass at this pretreatment \nwas 154.8\u00b15.3 g/kg biomass. Total glucose in the slurry at the end of liquefaction accounted for \n39% of cellulose ( 164.2 \u00b11.4 g/kg of biomass) with about 9 5% from enzyme hydrolysis  (Table \n1).  \n This liquefaction step also increased xylose concentration in the slurry indicating the \npresence of hemicellulose hydrolyzing activity in the enzyme mixture (Fig. 2). In contrast to \nglucose release, xylose release during liquefaction saturated at about 7 .5 FPU/g switchgrass. \nIncreasing the enzyme concentration beyond this level only led to very small increase in free \nxylose (about 10 g/kg) in the slurry.  Although about 20% of hemicellulose was hydrolyzed \nduring the 190 -1-7.5 pretreatment step, enzyme hydro lysis increased this to a total xylose yield 14 \n of 56%. About 65% of the xylose in the slurry at the end of liquefaction was generated during \nthe liquefaction step.  Arabinose concentration in the slurry at the end of liquefaction was less \nthan 20 g /kg switchg rass. Among the various pretreatment conditions  tested in this study, 1% \nacid gave the highest total sugar yield of about 0.46 ( 328.24\u00b17 g/kg biomass ) of the theoretical \nvalue  (Table 1) .  \n3.4 Furfural and HMF  \nAlthough phosphoric a cid pretreatment is milder than sulfuric acid  pretreatment , microbial \ngrowth inhibitors, such as furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural , etc. , are still generated during \npretreatment of biomass (Geddes et al., 2010; Zaldivar et al., 1999; Zha et al., 2014) . Similar \nresults were also obtained with switchgrass  treated with sulfuric acid (Djioleu & Carrier, 2016) . \nConcentration  of furans in the hydrolysate from the slurry was dependent on the severity of \nphosphoric acid pretreatment (0.3 -5.3 g/kg of switchgrass) with 190 -1-7.5 generating the highest \namount (Table 2). However, the furan content of the liquid fraction of the slurries increased in all \npretreatment condition s after liquefaction with enzymes  (Table 2). For example, furan content of \nhydrolysates from al l pretreatments at 175\u00b0C, was about 2 g of furans /kg of biomass irrespective \nof the time or acid concentration. The furan content of the same samples after liquefaction for 6 \nhours with 11.5 FPU cellulase activity  (per g biomass)  increased to an average o f 5.0 (4.3 -6.2) \ng/kg of biomass. T his increase was also dependent on the pretreatment temperature (Fig. 3). It is \nunlikely that the liquefaction step at pH 5.0 and 50 \u00b0C for 6 h generated additional furans by \ndehydrating sugars. Apparently, this increase is  due to release of furans generated during \npretreatment step from the solids  fraction  in the slurry to the liquid fraction as the carbohydrates \nwere hydrolyzed by the enzymes. This may reflect the fraction termed as pseudo -lignin \ngenerated during acid -based pretreatment of carbohydrates in biomass (Hu et al., 2013; Kumar et 15 \n al., 2013) . Hemicellulose (xylan) -derived -pseudo -lignin has be en reported to form at even \nmoderate severities of pretreatment as the case with phosphoric acid pretreatment at 160 -0.75-5. \nThis increase in furans used as an indicator here suggests that the concentration of other \ninhibitors also increased after liquefaction. Due to large differences in pretreatment conditions, it \nis difficult to compare the furan c ontent of switchgrass slurry from this study to other values in \nthe literature.  \n Increase in acetate concentration after liquefaction is expected due to hemicellulose \nhydrolysis while formate concentration actually decreased  at this step  (Table 2) .  \n3.5 Simultaneous saccharification and co -fermentation (SScF)  \nThe pH of the slurries after liquefaction at 50 \u00b0C was raised from 5.0 to 6.3 with NH 4OH and the \nsugars were fermented to ethanol using an ethanologenic E. coli  strain SL100. Strain SL100 \nferments bot h hexoses and pentoses to ethanol simultaneously (Geddes et al., 2013) . \nTemperature of SScF was 37\u00b0C, the optimum for E. coli  strain SL100. Although this temperature \nis not optimum for fungal cellulase activity, the enzymes contin ued to be active at this \ntemperature at a lower level compared to the activity at the optimum temperature of 50 \u00b0C (Patel \net al., 2005) . This continued activity of the enzymes is expected to release additional sugars that \nare also fermented to ethanol.  \n A typical fermentation profile is presented in Fig. 4A. The liquefied slurry from a \npretreatment condition of 1 75-1-7.5 contained glucose,  xylose and arabinose at 122.2\u00b14.3, \n113.0\u00b11.3 and 10.5\u00b11.1 g/kg switchgrass, respectively , for a total sugar content of 245.6 \u00b111.3 \ng/kg dry switchgrass  (Table 1) . This slurry also contained f urfural and HMF at a c oncentration of \n3.0\u00b10.2 and 1.3\u00b10.3 g/kg of  switchgrass, respectively  (Table 2) . At 10% solids loading, all the \nglucose was fermented during the first 24 h. Fermentation of xylose was complete in about 48 h. 16 \n There was no significant increase in ethanol after 48 h and the titer reached 17.2\u00b10.01  g/L and \nthe ethanol yield was 154.8\u00b10.03 g /kg of dry switchgrass  (Table 3) . Furfural (0.37\u00b10.07 g/L) and \nHMF (0.16\u00b10.04 g/L) in the starting slurry were not detectable at 24 h. B ased on the amount of \ncarbohydrates in the solids  after fermentation , a total of 396 g  of fermentable sugars (per kg of \nswitchgrass ) was released by pretreatment (175 -1-7.5) and enzyme hydrolysis , and 150 g  (per kg \nbiomass) of this total was released during SScF  by the enzymes carried over from the \nliquefaction step . In add ition to eth anol, small amount of acetate and lactate were also detected in \nthe broth.  Yield of ethanol for this pretreatment condition was 42% of the total carbohydrates in \nthe biomass and 77% of the amount of released sugars.  \n Increasing the temperature of pretreatment to  190\u00b0C keeping the acid concentration and \ntime the same (190 -1-7.5) yielded the highest amount of total sugars (Table 1) . However, this  \npretreatment condition  also generated the highest amount of furans  (5.3 g/kg of biomass) before \nliquefaction  (Table 2 ; Fig. 3 ). Even a t 10% solid s loading, furfural (0.71\u00b10.03 g/L) and HMF \n(0.12\u00b10.02 g/L) were present in the slurry at growth inhibitory concentration for strain SL100. It \ntook 48 h for strain SL100 to completely detoxify the furfural in the slurry  (Fig. 4B). Due to the \npresence of fur fural, growth and glucose fermentation w ere minimal during the first 24 h and a \nslight increase in glucose concentration in the medium at 24 h was due to continued hydrolysis of \ncellulose by the enzymes . After about a 20 h lag, glucose fermentation was linear until all the \nglucose was fermented by 72 h. At the end of th is experiment (96 h), about 4.5 g/L xylose was \nleft unfermented  in addition to about 3 g/L of galactose . At this pretreatment, ethanol titer was \n21.2\u00b10.3 g/L and ethanol  yield  was 190.4\u00b12.9 g/kg of dry switchgrass. Yield of ethanol on the \nbasis of total carbohydrates in the switchgrass  was 52% , a slight increase over the values from \nthe 175\u00b0C pretreatment.  17 \n Increasing the severity of pretreatment further is expected to  increase the concentration of \ninhibitors and prolong the lag period before growth and fermentation of total slurry start even \nwith furfural tolerant E. coli  strain SL100 . Similar lag before fermentation due to furans present \nin unfractionate d phosphoric acid treated corn stover hydrolysate was also reported for another \nethanologenic E. coli  (strain FBR5) (Avci et al., 2013a) . A combination of longer liquefaction \ntime and SScF at a higher temperature that favors enzyme hydrolysis using a thermotolerant \nmicrobial biocatalyst could improve the yield of ethanol from switchgrass without the need for \nincreasing the severity of pretreatment. Increasing the fermentation tim e beyond 96 h is another \nopportunity to increase ethanol titer without solids/liquids separation and/or detoxification of the \nslurry, both requiring additional process steps.   \n3.6 Effect of enzyme concentration on L+SScF  of switchgrass slurry  \nSince enzymes play a critical role in carbohydrate hydrolysis, it is expected that the \nethanol titer and yield are dependent on enzyme concentration , a significant cost component of \ncellulosic ethanol production (Gubiczaa et al., 2016; Lynd et al., 2017) . As described above, \nyield of sugar s increased with increasing enzyme concentration with the slurry from 190 -1-7.5 \nand saturated at about 11.5 FPU cellulase of Ce llic CTec3 per g biomass (Fig. 2 ). As expected, \nethanol titer also saturated at this enzyme concentration. When the enzyme concent ration at the \nliquefaction step was increased from 11.5 to 17.25 FPU/g biomass, the ethanol titer only \nincreased by 1. 4 g/L from 21.2\u00b10.32 to 22. 6\u00b10.04 g/L (Fig. 4). The ethanol yield fraction based \non the amount of sugars fermented at these enzyme concent rations averaged to 0.77\u00b10.1 . For  all \npretreatment  condition s and at the enzyme concentration  of 11.5 FPU/g biomass, the ethanol \nyield on the fermented sugars basis was 0.85 \u00b10.005 . Taking into account this conversion 18 \n efficiency of sugars to  ethanol, the yi eld of ethanol at a pretreatment of 190 -1-7.5 and 11.5 FPU \n/g biomass enzyme loading was 61% of the theoretical value.  \n3.7 Fermentation at higher solids content  \nTo increase the ethanol titer in fermentations  with a goal of improving energy efficiency during \ndistillation , solids content was increased from 10% to 15%. Since the slurry was used directly in \nthese fermentations, the concentration of inhibitors also increased  to 1.25 g/L of furans (furfural \n+HMF) f rom 0.83 g/L  at the 10% solids loading . It should be noted that in addition to furans the \nslurry contains several other inhibitory compounds at various concentrations. These chemicals \nact synergistically to control bacterial growth. Strain SL100 did not gr ow or ferment the sugars \nin the slurry at 15% solids content  due to the inhibitors . Upon detoxification as described in the \nMethods section, the slurry was fermented to ethanol but the ethanol content of the broth was \n22.57 g/L, a 1.32 g/L increase over th e titer at 10% solids loading. This is apparently due to poor \nmixing of enzymes with solids as seen by the release  of about 300 g total sugars /kg of biomass \nat 15% solids content compared to about 420 g total sugars /kg of biomass at 10% solids loading. \nNon-productive binding of cellulases with lignin at higher solids loading is another possibility \nfor lower sugar yield . These results suggest that further improvement in ethanol titer can be \nachieved by  reducing particle size for better mixing of the solids with enzymes combined with \nremoval of inhibitory compounds from the slurry by detoxification. These a dditional proce ss \nsteps , although beneficial,  are anticipated to  add to  the production cost of product, ethanol .   \n3.8 Mass balance  \nThe solids remaining after pretreatment and L+SScF accounted for 4 8 to 68% of switchgrass \nbased on the pretreatment condition (Table 4). An average of 94% of lignin in the starting \nswitchgrass was recovered in the solids from all pretreatments after L+SScF. T he carbohydrate 19 \n content of the solids varied from 31 to 57%  with the lower value from more severe pretreatment \ncondition while the higher value from less severe pretreatment. At the end of 6+96 hours of \nL+SScF, all the released sugars in the slurries were fermented for most of the pretreatment \nconditions except for th ree of the most severe pretreatment conditions tested (175 -1-10, 190 -\n0.75-5 and 190 -1-7.5). With these three pretreatment conditions, about 45 -50 g sugars per kg of \nbiomass , mostly pentoses,  remained unfermented at the end of 96 h (Table 5) . This is appare ntly \ndue to the lag before growth of strain SL100 started, resulting from  higher concentration of \ninhibitors generated during the three pretreatment conditions. Based on the fermentation profile, \nremaining sugars  at the end of 96 hours of SScF , lignin and ash, a mass balance of 94 to 100 % \nof starting biomass was recovered in these pretreatment conditions  (Table 5).  \n Various pretreatment conditions, such as AFEX, dilute acid (H 2SO 4), hot water or base \n(NH 4OH), we re employed for switchgrass and the ethanol titer and yield from these studies can \nbe found in e -version of this paper online . In these studies, pretreated slurries were further \nprocessed (solids/liquid separation, etc.) and the released sugars in hydrolys ates or from solids \nalone  after enzyme hydrolysis were fermented. Among the various processes tested, AFEX \npretreatment led to highest ethanol titer and yield. The reported ethanol titers of dilute acid \nprocesses were comparable to that of the phosphoric acid process described in this s tudy \nalthough additional process steps were employed in these studies. It may be necessary to \nminimize the process complexity to lower the final cost of ethanol produced from biomass  \n(Gubiczaa et al., 2016) . The three step process described here (Fig. 5) based on the L+SScF \nprocess deve loped for sugar cane bagasse (Geddes et al., 2013)  using phosphoric acid has the \npotential for cost-effective conversion of switchgr ass to fuels and chemicals.  \n4. Conclusion  20 \n  A simplified three step process for processing switchgrass to ethanol was adapted from \nthat of sugarcane bagasse (Fig. 5) (Geddes et al., 2013) . Switc hgrass  was pretreated with \nphosphoric acid and high-pressure steam. Entire slurry without removing any of the components \nwas liquefied with enzymes and f erment ed by an ethanologenic E. coli . Enzyme s required for \noptimal release of sugars during L+SScF  was about 12 FPU/g biomass. At this enzyme loading \nand a pretreatment condition of 190 -1-7.5, the ethanol titer was 21.2\u00b10.32 g/L at a solids loading \nof 10% (w/v) and the ethanol yield was 190.4\u00b12.92 g per kg of dry switchgrass .   \n5.

Bioconversion of Pelletized Grasses\nINTRODUCTION\nPerennial warm-season (C4) grasses have been proposed as a\nsustainable resource for producing sugars, chemicals, and f uels\nusing thermo-chemical and biochemical processes. The U.S.\nhas su\ufb03cient resources to grow an estimated 171 Tg yr\u22121\nof biomass from bioenergy grasses by 2022 ( Turhollow et al.,\n2014). Perennial warm-season grasses are favored for biomass\nproduction because of their high productivities and low input\nrequirements. In the case of switchgrass (SG, Panicum virgatum\nL.),ithasbeencalculatedthatitsconversiontofuelethan olwould\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions by 94% compared to gasoline,\nandthebioethanolwouldhaveatotalnetenergybalanceof54 0%\n(Schmeretal.,2008 ).Perennial,warmseasongrassesareidealfor\ninclusion in rainfed systems with variable precipitation bec ause\nof their high water use e\ufb03ciency and developed deep rooting\nsystems which also serve to stabilize and improve soil quality\n(Liebig et al., 2008; Blanco-Canqui et al., 2017 ). They are also\nnutrient-usee\ufb03cientbecausenitrogenandessentialeleme ntsare\ntranslocated to the soil, roots, and rhizomes during and aft er\nsenescence( Vogeletal.,2002;Mulkeyetal.,2008 ).\nThe United States Department of Agriculture has an ongoing\nlong-term project to develop biomass varieties of native prai rie\ngrasses for growth on marginal lands in the Great Plains and\nUpperMidwest( Andersonetal.,2016 ).Developmentofsuitable\ncultivars is particularly di\ufb03cult because they need to perfor m\nwell on marginal (e.g., low productivity, high erosion potent ial,\nlow pro\ufb01tability) rain-fed farmland to minimize land use\nchange from growing row crops. Therefore, in addition to high\nproduction, other important traits include drought resistan ce,\nquick,anddependableestablishment,resistancetolodging , low-\nnutrient demands, resistance to pathogens and insects, and\nhigh winter survival rates (e.g., over-wintering) ( Sarath et al.,\n2008). Breeding and management research requires a long-term\ncommitment because of the need to study establishment and\nmultiple production years on these traits. U.S.D.A., through i ts\nnorthern bioenergy centers, is developing and evaluating th ree\nnative prairie-based bioenergy cropping systems: switchgras s,\nbig bluestem ( Andropogon gerardii Vitman), and a low-diversity\ngrassmixture( Andersonetal.,2016 ).\nOf these perennial bioenergy crops, SG is perhaps the most\nhighly developed as judged by past \ufb01eld studies ( McLaughlin\nandKszos,2005;Moore etal.,2014 ),availablebiomasscultivars,\ntraditional, and molecular breeding research ( Lipka et al., 2014;\nVogel et al., 2014; Biswal et al., 2018 ), and other available tools\n(e.g.,NIRcalibrations)( Vogeletal.,2011;Serapigliaetal.,2017 ).\nBig bluestem (BBS) is a bioenergy crop of growing interest\nbecause of its high productivity, good genetic diversity, an d\necological role as the dominant prairie species ( Moore et al.,\n2014;Zhangetal.,2015 ).YetdevelopmentofBBSasabioenergy\ncrop has lagged considerably behind that of SG ( Zhang et al.,\n2015). Finally,there is interest in cultivatingpastures contai ning\nmultiplespeciestoemulatenaturalprairiesforpossibleecolog ical\nbene\ufb01ts ( Tilman et al., 2006 ). However, it is a challenge to\ndevelop a mixture of grasses that maintains both diversity a nd\nhigh production over multiple years and cuttings. The crops\nselected here represent a signi\ufb01cant advance over previouslycultivated grasses. For example, Liberty SwitchgrassTMis the\n\ufb01rst bioenergy developed variety released by the USDA ( Vogel\net al., 2014 ), following a long breeding and selection process\nfor high productivity and good over-wintering survival, and is\nonly presently being evaluated in commercially relevant \ufb01eld\nplots. Likewise, the BBS crop used for this study is a mixture\nof two cultivars to maximize yield and stand health. There\nis also a need for further testing of polyculture plantings of\ngrassesforbioenergyproductiongiventhesparsityofpaststu dies\nusingde\ufb01nedgrassmixturesinverylimitedgeographicalgro wth\nregions (Robertson et al., 2017 ). Here, we describe a relevant\nmixture of grasses based on established high production gras ses\namenable to cutting and processing to value-added products.\nThis unique low diversity mixture (LDM) is comprised of BBS,\nindiangrass ( Sorghastrum nutans (L.) Nash), and sideoats grama\n[Boutelouacurtipendula (Michx.)Torr.].\nEach has shown good establishment and persistence in\nproduction \ufb01elds located on marginal rain-fed farmland locat ed\nin northeastern Nebraska ( Blanco-Canqui et al., 2017 ). Earlier\nresearch established that all three crops were equally bene\ufb01c ial\nforimprovingsoilquality( Blanco-Canquietal.,2017 ).\nHowever,conversionofharvestedbiomasstoethanolrequir es\ntransportingthebiomasstothebiore\ufb01nerygate,pre-treatin gitto\ndeconstruct the cell wall structure, extracting the carbohy drates\nasfermentablesugarsusingcellulasesandotherrelatedenz ymes,\nand fermenting the freed sugars to ethanol or other biofuels\n(for a review: Dien and Bothast, 2009 ). Therefore, the suitability\nof a bioenergy crop depends on more than solely crop yield.\nThis study evaluates the performance of these three promising\nbioenergycropsforpre-processingandbioconversiontoethan ol.\nAmajorimpedimenttousingherbaceousbioenergycropsfor\nindustrial-scaled bioconversion is solving the logistica l supply\nchallenge of getting the biomass to the biore\ufb01nery gate ( Hansen\net al., 2015 ). Biore\ufb01neries are projected to be very large and\nto require considerable quantities of biomass to operate at\ncost-e\ufb00ective scales. For example, U.S. Department of Energy\n(DOE) cellulosic ethanol cost estimates are based upon a\nplant consuming 2,000 metric ton/day ( Humbird et al., 2011 ).\nMeanwhile,choppedorbaledgrassisdi\ufb03culttostore,transport ,\nand process on the front end because it has low-bulk density\nand poor \ufb02ow properties. This challenge can be addressed\nby densifying and reforming the biomass. There are several\navailablemethodsfordensifyingandreformingbiomassofw hich\nthe pellet mill and briquette press are the most popular that\nare compatible with biochemical conversion ( Tumuluru et al.,\n2011). A pellet mill has several advantages in terms of low\nmachine maintenance, e\ufb03cient, and e\ufb00ective densi\ufb01cation, an d\npellets have better handling properties compared to briquettes\n(Tumuluruetal.,2011 ).Itisalsothemostcommondensi\ufb01cation\nmethodusedforbiochemicalprocesses.Inthisstudy,pelletsw ere\ncomparedtonon-pellets(e.g.,baledbiomass).Furthermore,t his\nstudy is unique in that an ongoing commercial feed mill was\nusedtomanufacturethepellets.Useofapre-existingcommercia l\nplant located nearby can save on capital costs (if also used for\nprocessing forages) and as done here allows for processing to b e\ntrialed on a multi-ton scale, which is also a\ufb00orded by the scale\nofthecrop\ufb01eldtrialconductedhere.Asuccessfuloutcomefr om\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org 2 December 2018 | Volume 6 | Article 129Dien et al.

Two of these studies pelletized corn stover with\nammonium \ufb01ber expansion (AFEX) pre-treatment ( Bals et al.,\n2014; Hoover et al., 2014 ). Other studies used a conventional\npelletizingprocessfollowedbyeitherpre-treatmentswithdi lute-\nacid (Rijal et al., 2012; Ray et al., 2013; Wolfrum et al., 2017 ),\nionic liquids ( Shi et al., 2013 ), or ammonium hydroxide at room\ntemperature ( Rijal et al., 2012 ). Much of the literature concerns\nthein\ufb02uenceofpelletsonchemicalcompositionandbiochemic al\nconversion.Thisisunderstandablegiventhatpelletizingb iomass\ninvolves heating and high-pressure steps likely to alter the\nchemical and certainly the physical nature of the biomass ( Stelte\net al., 2012 ).

We have chosen to compare the crops using two pre-\ntreatmenttechniques:liquidhotwater(LHW)andlow-moist ure\nammonium hydroxide (LMA). Liquid hot-water, as its name\nimplies, reacts biomass in the presence of hot-water (e.g., 18 0\u2013\n200\u25e6C) (Mosier et al., 2005a ). It has been a popular choice in\nthe literature because it combines some of the advantages of\nan acid catalyzed pre-treatment without the disadvantages o f\nusing a mineral acid ( Mosier et al., 2005b ). It also generally\nproduces lower amounts of inhibitors compared to dilute-acid\npre-treatment. LMA is relatively new and involves treating lo w-\nmoisturebiomasswithammoniumhydroxide( Kimetal.,2016 ).\nIt is of interest because it employs a static reactor and does n ot\nrequire a dewatering step. We included both pre-treatments to\nevaluate the biomass samples using both acid and base based\npre-treatments.\nTo summarize, in this study established production \ufb01elds of\nBBS, LDM, and SG were harvested, \ufb01eld dried, and formed into\nround bales. Biomass yields for BBS, LDM, and SG were 7.4,\n9.4, and 9.6 Mg/ha, respectively. The bales were transported\nto a nearby alfalfa feed operation and converted into pellets.These pellets were characterized for bulk density and chemical\ncomposition. Ground and pelletized biomasses were pre-treated\nwith LHW and LMA. LHW pre-treated samples were evaluated\nforenzymaticconversiontosugarsandLMApre-treatedsamples\nfor conversion to sugars and ethanol, the latter using a yeast\nthat is capable of fermenting both glucose and xylose. The goal\nwas to determine which crop(s) is most suited as a feedstock for\nbioethanolproduction.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nChemicals and Media\nAll media and chemicals were research grade and purchased\nfrom either Fisher Scienti\ufb01c or Sigma Aldrich Chemicals.\nThe enzymes used were commercial formulations of cellulases\n(140mgprotein/mlCTEC3,NovozymesInc.)andhemicellulase s\n(HTEC2, 109mg protein/ml). Enzyme activities were measured\nusing previously reported methods ( Dien et al., 2008 ). The yeast\nSche\ufb00ersomycesstipitis Y-50871(ARSCultureCollection,Peoria,\nIL) was used for fermentations. This strain has been extensi vely\nevolved and selected for ethanol fermentation of glucose/xy lose\nsugars prepared from alkaline pre-treated biomass ( Slininger\netal.,2015 ).\nBiomass Samples and Pelletizing\nThe sample set included BBS, Liberty SG, and a LDM consisting\nofBBS,indiangrass,and\u201cButte\u201dsideoatsgrama.BBSwassee ded\nas an equal blend of \u201cBonanza\u201dand \u201cGoldmine\u201d and indiangras s\nas an equal blend of \u201cScout\u201d and \u201cWarrior,\u201d both on a pure live\nseed basis.

The straws were\ncondensed from a beginning density of 128\u2013133 kg/m3to a\n\ufb01nal density of 528\u2013554 kg/m3, which is a 407% increase in\nbulk density across all biomasses. Pellet mean diameters (6 .52\u2013\n6.58mm) were close to the speci\ufb01ed diameter (6.35mm) with\nrelatively low standard deviations (1.41\u20131.57%).

LMA was selected over LHW\nbecause sugar yields using the former were more consistent\nacross the di\ufb00erent biomass feedstocks. The hydrolysate was\nsupplemented with nutrients, and fermented to ethanol using S.\nstipitisyeast.\nPre-treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis (e.g., pre-\nfermentation) recovered 69.7\u201376.8% and 70.1\u201377.1% of the\navailable glucose and xylose, respectively ( Table4).

In addition, lignin content w as\nlower for LDM (169.3 g/kg) compared to the other two grasses.\nMost important, all three grass crops had similar theoretical\nethanol yields on a mass basis and for non-pellets this value\nexceededthatofcornstover( Figure3).\nIf the biomass needs to be trucked to the factory gate,\ndensifying should allow for more e\ufb03cient transport. Trucks\noperate most e\ufb00ectively when \ufb01lled with cargo to their weight\nlimit. For a truck with a trailer volume of 70\u201390 m3, this\nrequires a minimum bulk density of 270\u2013320 kg/m3(Thoreson\net al., 2010 ). The mean bulk densities for the three pelletized\nbiomass samples (528\u2013554 kg/m3) consistently exceed this limit\n(Figure2).Incontrast,priortocompacting(128\u2013135kg/m3),the\ntruckswouldbeoperatingat <50%e\ufb03ciency.Thedenserpellets\nare also expected to be more convenient to store vs. round bale s\nor chopped grass or at least this was found to be the case in this\nlaboratory.\nBulk densities of grasses for di\ufb00erent presentations are\nreviewed by Sokhansanj et al.

This study\ndemonstrates that it is likewise possible to manufacture pell ets\nusing heterogeneous grasses harvested from a \ufb01eld planted wit h\nmultipleplantspecies.\nForming pellets led to small but signi\ufb01cant ( p<0.05)\ndecreases in glucans (2.6% on average) and xylans (1.7%) for\nall the feedstocks. Most, but not all ( Theerarattananoon et al.,\n2012; Wolfrum et al., 2017 ), previous studies also reported\ndecreased glucan (1\u20134%) and xylose (2\u20134%) contents for pellets\ncompared to beginning straws ( Rijal et al., 2012; Ray et al.,\n2013; Shi et al., 2013; Bals et al., 2014 ). Varied results are not\nsurprisingbecausepelletizinginvolvesacombinationofhea tand\nhigh pressure to compress biomass and form durable pellets.\nFormation of durable pellets depends upon operating above\nthe glass transition state for lignin and forming cross link ages\nbetween carbohydrates, lignin, and other plant cell componen ts\n(Kaliyan and Morey, 2010; Tumuluru et al., 2011 ). Decreased\nglucan and xylan contents did not appear to be correlated with\nfeedstock type. The techniques used here might also overlook\nchanges in lignin composition. Combinations of carbohydrat es\nand lignin extractives form compounds termed pseudo-lignin,\nwhich are detected as Klason lignin ( Sannigrahi et al., 2011 ).\nLikewise, scale did not play a role, though this study is the \ufb01r st\nto use pellets made by an existing commercial plant. Finally,\nthe reader is cautioned that observed decreases in carbohyd rate\ncontents are near the practical detection limits of standard\nanalytical methods (1\u20133% relative standard deviations) us ed\nto determine composition ( Templeton et al., 2010 ), which is\ncompounded in the case of mixtures by the opportunity for\nadditionalsamplingerror.\nConversion of Biomass to Sugars and\nEthanol\nConversionyieldswerenextmeasuredbypre-treatingpellets and\nnon-pelletsandmeasuringglucoseandxylosereleasedfollow ing\nenzymatic hydrolysis. Two pre-treatments were selected forthis study: liquid hot-water and low moisture ammonium\npre-treatments. LHW involves pre-treating biomass at high\ntemperatures solely with water ( Mosier et al., 2005a ). LHW was\nselected because it avoids the use of a mineral catalyst (e.g.,\nsulfuric acid), has been reported to minimize the formation o f\nfurfural because xylan is not hydrolyzed all the way to xylose\n(Mosier et al., 2005b ), and has been successfully applied in\nthe past to switchgrass ( Kim et al., 2011 ). LMA is similar to\nlow moisture anhydrous ammonium pre-treatment (LMAA)\n(Yoo et al., 2011 ) but in which ammonium is added as a\nconcentrated ammonium hydroxide solution. LMA was selected\nas a representative alkaline pre-treatment because it is simpl e to\nimplement, and ammonia pre-treated biomass does not require\nextensive conditioning prior to fermentation ( Dien et al., 2013 ).\nBiomassistreatedasamoistsolidandisincubatedinastati coven\nfollowing a brief mixing step.

Two pre-treatment technologies were selected because\nthey re\ufb02ect two di\ufb00erent chemistries (e.g., acid and base). LH W\nand LMA pre-treated samples were assayed for sugar yields in\nlow-solids digestions. LMA pre-treated samples were also used\nfor two-stage high solids hydrolysis and ethanol fermentati on\n(SHF).\nLHW proved to be an e\ufb00ective pre-treatment.

However, a 2 and 5% reduction in glucose and\nxylose yields (g/kg biomass, db), respectively was signi\ufb01ca nt (p\n<0.05) following the high-solids LMA hydrolysis even though\nhydrolysis e\ufb03ciencies were mostly higher for pellets vs. non-\npellets.

St udies\nthat use dilute-acid or ionic liquid did not observe a signi\ufb01 cant\ndi\ufb00erence in product yields between non-pellets and pellets\n(Rijaletal.,2012;Theerarattananoonetal.,2012;Rayetal. ,2013;\nShi et al., 2013; Wolfrum et al., 2017 ) with one exception. Corn\nstover pellets treated with a low severity dilute acid, washe d,\nand converted using SSF gave a higher ethanol yield e\ufb03ciency\n(84% of theoretical) vs. the ground straw (68% of theoretica l)\n(Rayetal.,2013 ).However,inthesamestudy,whenapilotscale\ndilute-acid reactor was used, no di\ufb00erence was observed unde r\noptimal reaction conditions. In general, high severity or mo re\ne\ufb00ective pre-treatments (e.g., ionic liquid) would hide subtl e\ndi\ufb00erences in biomass properties associated with pelletizing.\nA study applying ammonium pre-treatment conducted at\nambient temperature using switchgrass did not reveal any\ndi\ufb00erences in glucan conversion, but xylan conversion was\nincreased 10% ( Rijal et al., 2012 ). A previously mentioned study\nthat used SAA reported a 76% improvement in glucose yield\nfrom pelletizing ( Nahar and Pryor, 2014 ). Processes that used\nAFEX pre-processed pellets did not report improved hydrolysis\nsugar yields, perhaps, because AFEX is a highly e\ufb00ective pre-\ntreatment on herbaceous biomass in general. However, one of\nthe AFEX studies emphasized that lower adsorption of water\nby the pellets compared to the straw led to a more e\ufb03cient\nhydrolysis at high-solids because biomass did not need to be\nfed into the reactor over time ( Bals et al., 2014 ).

Bioconversion of Pelletized Grasses\n(personal observation by Dien). In summary, pelletizing does\nnot lower product yields and might slightly promote conversio n\ne\ufb03ciency.\nTheaforementionedlogisticaladvantageshavetobebalanc ed\nagainst the added cost and energy inputs associated with\nmaking pellets. A typical biore\ufb01nery is expected to be scaled\nto process 2,000 Mg/day of biomass. At this scale, baled SG\nis estimated to cost $80.64 /Mg at the factory gate and baling\nand transport will consume equivalent to 8.5% of the higher\nheating value (HHV) of the biomass. In contrast to baled SG,\npellets are estimated to cost less ($71.76/Mg) and consume\nless energy (7.8% HHV) ( Sokhansanj et al., 2009 ). The major\nenergy used to make pellets goes to drying the biomass. It\nhas been suggested adapting the process for bioenergy crops\nto increase drying e\ufb03ciency can a\ufb00ord considerable energy\nand cost savings ( Lamers et al., 2015 ). However, densifying the\nbiomass may be necessary to reduce \ufb01nancial risks associate d\nwith relying on a regional feedstock. In other words, increa sed\ninvestor risk has an associated cost and eliminating this ri sk\nis expected to more than make up for the cost of pelletizing\n(Hansenetal.,2015 ).\nComparison of Feedstocks\nThere was no signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erence among the samples based\nuponethanolyieldsfollowingSHF.However,standarddeviat ions\ntendtobehigherforfermentationstudiesthanforthebegin ning\nhydrolysis step perhaps because of the added yeast fermentati on\nstep. In this case, BBS and LDM had signi\ufb01cantly higher glucos e\nyields compared to that of SG. Xylose yields were similar amon g\nthe grasses. The 3-year average biomass yields for BBS, LDM,\nand SG were 7.4, 9.4, and 9.6 Mg/ha. Therefore, di\ufb00erences\nin conversion yields are minor compared to those observed\nfor biomass production. These crop productivities translate to\nethanol production levels of 1,952, 2,586, and 2,636l of etha nol\nperha.\nCONCLUSION\nThree new \ufb01eld grown bioenergy grass crops were compared\nfor composition, response to commercial scaled pelleting,\nand processing to sugars and ethanol. LDM had a higher\nglucan content than either BBS or SG ( p\u22640.01) but no\ndi\ufb00erences were observed for total fermentable carbohydrat es\nand ethanol yields per ton of biomass. On a land basis, theestimatedproductivitieswere1,952,2,586,and2,636lofet hanol\nperha.\nThe use of pellets compared to straw does not impact sugar\nand ethanol yields. This was found to be the case with LHW\n(sugars) and LMA (sugars and ethanol) pre-treatments. We did\nsee a slight reduction in glucan and xylan contents associate d\nwith the pellets ( p=0.014), which agrees with most but not all\nprior reports. The con\ufb02icting conclusions might be attribute d\nto (in this case) use of a commercial scale feed plant and likely\nvariation in conditions used to form pellets across studies.

        "text_abstract": "This study investigates the bioconversion of pelletized Big Bluestem, Switchgrass, and Low-Diversity Grass Mixtures into sugars and bioethanol. These warm-season grasses were pelletized without binder and demonstrated a 407% increase in bulk density on average, making them suitable for bioethanol production on a commercial scale. The pelletizing process slightly reduced glucan and xylan contents but did not significantly impact the theoretical ethanol yields from each biomass. Chemical pretreatments (liquid hot water and low-moisture ammonium hydroxide) and enzymatic hydrolysis showed that carbohydrates in pellets were recovered more efficiently compared to non-pellets. Finally, ethanol yields were similar for all grasses, suggesting that each has potential as a bioenergy crop.",
        "text_novelty": "The research uniquely applied commercial-scale pelletizing to warm-season grasses for bioethanol production, demonstrating effective bulk density increase without the need for binders. It further evaluated the effect of pelletizing on biomass composition and bioconversion efficiency, showing that pelletizing slightly reduces glucan and xylan contents but improves handling and processing efficiency. This study is one of the first to compare bioethanol production from pelletized Big Bluestem, Switchgrass, and Low-Diversity Grass Mixtures, contributing novel insights into their potential as sustainable bioenergy crops.",
