Biodiesel production by transesterifi cation
Biodiesel production from the extracted lipids follows 
the process model developed in a previous study.2 Th e 
process consists of transesterifi cation, biodiesel purifi -
cation, and glycerol recovery and purifi cation (Fig. 1). 
Transesterifi cation of the lipids with methanol, catalyzed 
by sodium methoxide, is conducted as a continuous reac-
tion in a stirred tank reactor at 60 °C. Th e transesterifi ca-
tion process continuously converts lipids and methanol to 
biodiesel and glycerol. Following a 1 h transesterifi cation 
reaction, a continuous centrifuge is used to remove the 
glycerol-rich coproduct phase, which is sent to the glycerol 
recovery unit. Th e biodiesel stream, which also contains 
unreacted methanol and lipids, is fed to a second reac-
tion tank, wheremore sodium methoxide and methanol 
are added. Th e second transesterifi cation reaction is con-
ducted for1 hr. A transesterifi cation effi  ciency of 90% was 
assumed for each of the two transesterifi cation-reactions, 
which resulted inan overall effi  ciency of 99% based on the 
lipid content.2, 36 Th e unreacted methanol is recovered 
by vacuum evaporation followed by condensation for 
recycling.
Th e crude biodiesel stream is washed with hydrochloric 
acid and water to neutralize the catalyst (sodium meth-
oxide) and convert any soap to free fatty acids, thereby 
reducing the fl uid emulsifying tendencies. A continuous 
centrifuge is then used to separate the biodiesel from the 
aqueous phase. A vacuum drying process is applied to 
reduce the water content to 450 ppm. Th e crude glycerol 
stream is treated with the same process (hydrochloric acid 
and then caustic solution), and the processed crude glyc-
erol has a purity of 80%.2
Ethanol production by fermentation
As in a modern sugarcane plant, the sugar solution is con-
centrated to 20% solute through a multiple eff ect evapora-
tor (Fig. 1). Th e concentrated sugar solutionis cooled to 
32  °C and fed into the fermenters, where a fermentation 
process with yeast is conducted. During fermentation, 
yeasts convert the sugars to ethanol and carbon dioxide. 
Cooling water is continuously provided to keep the fer-
mentation temperature at 32 °C. Aft  er fermentation, the 
wine (water, ethanol, and yeast mix) is sent to centrifuges 
to separate the yeasts, which are treated with sulfuric acid 
solution to prevent bacterial contamination and recycled 
for use in further fermentation batches.
Aft  er removing the yeasts, the wine is sent to the distil-
lation process to recover the ethanol. Before being sent 
to the distillation column, the wine is preheated in heat 
the harvest machines, to prevent potential damage to the 
mill tandem, i.e. several crushing and extraction units 
in sequence. No washing is carried out on the lipid-cane 
prior to crushing due to the high sugar and lipid losses 
that would result from washing mechanically harvested 
lipid-cane prior to extraction.30
Lipid/sugar extraction
Shredders are used to cut the lipid-canestem to enhance 
the lipid and sugar extraction in the extraction step 
(Fig. 1). Th e juice extraction of the shredded lipid-cane 
follows the current well-established mechanical method 
(mill tandem) in sugarcane industry, with the assistance 
of enzymatic hydrolysis. During the extraction, process 
condensed water (imbibition water) at 60 °C is added at the 
fi nal stage of the tandem to improve the lipid and sugar 
recovery. Protease enzyme is added at 0.5% concentration, 
to break down proteins, including oleosin that surrounds 
the lipid bodies.32 Enzymes have been successfully applied 
to enhance aqueous extraction of lipids from diff erent 
biomass materials.33–35 Th e extracted juice contains water, 
lipids, sugar, and impurities such as fi ber fragments, min-
erals, and soil particles. A rotary screen is used to remove 
the fi ber fragments from the juice; these are returned to 
the mills for further recovery of lipids and sugar, and 
the juice is sent to the clarifi cation process. Based on the 
information collected from sugarcane and soybean pro-
cessing plants, it is assumed that 90% of the lipids and 96% 
of the sugar are extracted from the lipid-cane. A sensitivity 
analysis is conducted to evaluate the eff ect of the extrac-
tion effi  ciency on the process economic performance.
Th e extracted juice is piped to a temporary storage tank 
that provides  a constant feed to the juice treatment pro-
cess (Fig. 1). Th e juice is heated from 35 to 70 °C, followed 
by the addition of phosphoric acid to reduce the pH to 4.5 
and followed by the addition of lime (calcium hydroxide) 
to increase the pH to 7 to remove impurities by forming 
calcium phosphate particles. A second heating is then 
applied to the juice to increase the temperature to 105 °C 
to remove dissolved air. Flocculant polymer is added to 
separate fi ne fi ber fragments and soil particles from the 
juice in a settling tank. Th e juice then separates into three 
parts: lipids fl oating on the top, a sugar solution, and a 
mud debris of solid particles at the bottom of the settling 
tank. Th e mud is washed with fresh water to recover the 
remaining sugar using a rotary vacuum fi lter. Th e washed 
solution is recycled to the process prior to the settling 
tank, and the remaining material on the fi lter, termed fi lter 
cake, may be used as a component of animal feed or for 
composting.27 19321031, 2016, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bbb.1640 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [02/02/2024].

To meet the target of 96 million-liters/yr for biodiesel 
production, the required mass of soybeans to be crushed 
is approximately 500 000 MT/yr. With an expected 330 
working days per year, the required throughput is approxi-
mately 1500 MT/day. Th e soybeans contain 13% water, 18% 
lipids, 37% crude protein, 28% carbohydrates, and 4% ash. 
Th e process includes two parts: (i) soybean crushing and 
oil refi ning and (ii) biodiesel production from refi ned oil 
(Fig. 2). Th e key parameters are provided in Table 3. Aft  er  
receiving the soybeans, the fi rst step is to clean them to 
remove foreign materials, such as stems, pods, dirt, sand, 
and rocks, because such foreign materials reduce the oil 
and protein content and adversely aff ect oil quality. Th e 
cleaned soybeans are sent to a dehulling process to remove 
their hulls, which are toasted and grinded before being 
transported to a storage room. Aft  er the dehulling process, 
the cracked soybeans are subjected to conditioning, fl ak-
ing, and expending processes, which help extract oil in 
the following extraction step. Th e soybean fl akes are then 
sent to the oil extraction process, where hexane is used 
as a solvent to extract the oil. Th e oil extraction effi  ciency 
is assumed to be 95%, based on the data collected from a 
soybean plant.  Th e hexane in the oil and the spent soy-
bean fl akes is then evaporated and recycled. Th e spent soy-
bean fl akes are ground to produce soybean meal and are 
sold as animal feed. Th e hexane-free soy oil is referred to 
as crude soy oil and is sent to the oil refi ning process.
exchangers by the fl ow coming from the bottom of the 
distillation column. Th e fi rst step in the ethanol recovery 
is the distillation column, which captures nearly all of the 
ethanol in the wine. Th e distillated ethanol solution con-
tains almost an equal amount of water, so a second stage 
of distillation (rectifi er column) is used. Upon completion 
of this second stage, the distillate is approximately 90% 
ethanol, and molecular sieves then remove further water 
to provide ethanol of 99% purity (w/w). Th e bottom fl ow 
from the distillation column, termed vinasse, contains 
water and nutrients including protein, fi bers, and other 
unfermentable chemicals. Th is material can be utilized for 
both the irrigation and fertilization of the cane plantations 
that surround the ethanol production facility.27
Cogeneration system
Bagasse, a byproduct of the lipid-cane process, is burned 
to produce steam and generate electricity for the plant, 
with the excess sold to the grid for additional revenue. 
Th e cogeneration units comprise a combustor for burning 
bagasse, a boiler for generating steam, and a turbogenerator 
for converting thermal energy to electricity (Fig. 1). Such a 
cogeneration system using wet biomass has been included 
in aprocess model developed by the National Renewable 
Energy Laboratory (NREL).31 Th e conceptual design and 
technical data in the NREL report were utilized for the 
simulation of the cogeneration unit in this study. 
Bagasse with 50% moisture content is fed to the combus-
tor to be burned to generate heat. Th e total heating value 
is calculated by the imbedded combustor-modules in the 
SuperPro Designer based on the material composition. Th e 
boiler effi  ciency was assumed to be 80%.31 Flue gas leaving 
the boiler preheats the air required to burn the bagasse. A 
turbogenerator uses a multistage turbine with two steam 
extraction ports and a fi nal condenser. Th e fi rst extracted 
steam (1.48 MPa, 268 °C) is used to preheat the water 
before entering the boiler. Th e second steam is extracted 
at 0.44 MPa (152 °C) and is used in ethanol distillation, 
juice heating, and other processes. Th e rest of the steam is 
condensed at 10 kPa (45.8 °C) to maximally increase the 
electricity production. 
Soy-biodiesel process
Th e soy-biodiesel process model is based on the model 
developed by the USDA ARS (Agricultural Research 
Service) research lab (unpublished). Th e capacity of the 
soy-biodiesel plant was set to 96 million liters (25 million 
gallons) biodiesel per year, which is the same as the capac-
ity of the lipid-cane (20% lipid content) processing plant.

MT of sugarcane (Fig. 3). Th is number agrees with previ-
ous studies, where the ethanol yield per MT of sugarcane 
was between 82 and 93 liters.27, 29, 42, 45 Th ese results con-
fi rm the validity of the data obtained from our model 
and the assumptions considered. For the lipid-cane with 
2% lipids, 6.0 liters of biodiesel and 79.9 liters of ethanol 
were produced per MT of lipid-cane. As the lipid con-
tent increases, the ethanol production decreases, but the 
biodiesel production increases. Th is result makes sense 
because more sugar was diverted to produce oil. For the 
lipid-cane with 20% lipids, 60.1 liters of biodiesel can be 
produced from each MT of lipid-cane, but no ethanol 
was produced due to the little sugar remaining in the 
lipid-cane. 
Electricity from bagasse plays an important role in mod-
ern sugarcane processing plants.46–48 In the sugarcane 
plant, bagasse is burned to produce steam and electricity 
for the plant,46 with the surplus electricity sold to the grid 
to generate co-product credits. Th e steam and electric-
ity requirements for the processes of soybean biodiesel, 
sugarcane, and lipid-cane with 10 and 20% lipid contents 
are shown in Table 7. It is worth notice that the steam 
requirement for the lipid-cane with 20% lipid was sig-
nifi cantly lower compared to that for the sugarcane and 
lipid-cane with 10% lipid. Th is is because all sucrose has 
been converted to TAGs in this scenario and so there is 
no fermentation or ethanol evaporation when lipid-cane 
with 20% lipid, so the steam usage was low. Th e electric-
ity used by the sugarcane and lipid-cane processing plants 
were between 50 000 and 53 000 MWh per year, which 
corresponded to approximately 31 to 33 MWh per MT of 
sugarcane processed. It is should be noted that due to the 
combustion of bagasse, no external energies (i.e., fossil 
fuel) is needed at modern the sugarcane processes. Th is 
makes sugarcane process self-sustainable in energy.29
Th e surplus electricity production is approximately 61 
kWh per MT of sugarcane (Fig. 3). Th is number is slightly 
lower than the previously reported value of 68 kWh per 
MT of sugarcane.29 According to the UNICA report, up 
to 96 kWh total electricity (electricity used in the  process

was lower than that from soybean. Th e remaining sugar 
in the 2% lipid-cane was fermented to produce ethanol 
at a production cost of $0.46/liter, which could further 
improve the economics of the lipid-cane process. With the 
increase in lipid content, both the biodiesel and ethanol 
production costs from the lipid-cane decreased accord-
ingly. As the lipid content increased to 5%, the biodiesel 
and ethanol production costs decreased to $0.84 and 
$0.44/liter, respectively. Th e lower production cost of lipid-
cane is primarily attributed to the lower feedstock cost 
of lipid-cane compared with that of soybean. As the lipid 
content increased to 20%, the biodiesel production cost 
further decreased to $0.59/liter, which made it competitive 
with petroleum diesel. 
Th e details of the unit production costs of processes with 
diff erent feedstocks are shown in Table 8. For conciseness, 
only the production costs from soybean, normal sugar-
cane, and lipid-cane with lipid contents of 10 and 20% are 
plus surplus electricity) can be generated using the lat-
est extraction-condensation technology.28 With the 
increase in lipid content, the surplus electricity production 
increases substantially due to the higher fraction of fi ber 
in the lipid-cane. Furthermore, only 90% of the lipids in 
the lipid-cane were extracted in the extraction process, 
where as the rest 10% of the lipids remained in bagasse 
and was burned in the cogeneration system, which further 
increased the electricity production.
Th e resulting unit production costs for biodiesel and 
ethanol are shown in Fig. 4. Th e biodiesel production cost 
from soybeans is estimated to be $1.08/liter. In the USA, 
the bulk petroleum diesel fuel prices during 2013 were 
generally in the range of $0.82‒0.98/liter,9 which was lower 
than the production cost of the soy biodiesel estimated 
here. Th is fi nding indicates the economic diffi  culty of the 
soy biodiesel process without policy support. Th e biodiesel 
production cost from 2% lipid-cane was $0.89/liter, which

Modeling and Analysis: Biodiesel and ethanol co-production from lipid-producing sugarcane H Huang, S Long, V Singh

presented. For all processes, raw material costs constituted 
the largest portion of the total operating cost, and of the 
raw material costs, the feedstock costs (i.e., soybeans, sug-
arcane, and lipid-cane) accounted for the largest portion. 
Th erefore, feedstock costs are the main contributor to the 
biodiesel and ethanol production costs. Similar estimates 
that the feedstock cost was the greatest contribution to 
the biodiesel production cost were reported in other stud-
ies.2,11,49 Due to the lower feedstock cost, the biodiesel pro-
duction cost from the lipid-cane process is lower than that 
from the soybean process.
Profi tability analysis
Because the lipid-cane process has a much higher total 
capital investment than the soy-biodiesel process does, 
the lower biofuel unit production cost of the lipid-cane 
process may not necessary indicate a better economic 
performance. Th erefore, the IRR was calculated to evalu-
ate the economic performance of each scenario (Fig. 5). 
Despite the lower unit biodiesel production cost compared 
with the conventional soy-biodiesel process, the process of 
lipid-cane with 2% lipid content had a lower IRR due to its 
higher total capital investment. However, it has a slightly 
higher IRR than the normal sugarcane process. Th e IRR 
value of the lipid-cane process increases as the lipid con-
tent increases. When the lipid content increases to 5%, the 
IRR value of the lipid-cane process becomes comparable 
to that of the soy-biodiesel process. For the 20% lipid cane, 
there was no sugar left  in the stem; thus, no sugar separa-
tion, fermentation, or distillation was needed in the pro-
cess, which signifi cantly reduced the related capital and 
energy costs. Th erefore, when the lipid content in the lipid-
cane increased from 10 to 20%, the IRR value of the pro-
cess increased remarkably from 17.5 to 24.0%. Th e IRR of 
the 20% lipid content lipid-cane process was much higher 
than that of the soybean process.
Sensitivity analysis
Senstivity analyses were performed to test variables that 
were uncertain and those were found to signifi cantly aff ect

the biodiesel production cost (Fig. 6). Two cases were ana-
lyzed. Th e fi rst case was the process of lipid-cane with 10% 
lipid concentrations, and the second case was the soybean-
biodiesel process. In both cases, low and high points were 
chosen, which were then combined to give an estimate of 
the accumulated eff ect of the various parameters changes 
on the biodiesel production costs (Fig. 7). 
First, we varied the cost of lipid-cane price, as there 
is signifi cant uncertainty regarding lipid-cane costs 
and these have a very large infl uence on the biodiesel 
production cost. Th e cost of lipid-cane price was based 
on the average sugarcane price in 2013. It is possible that 
the genetically modifi ed lipid-cane would have a higher 
price compared to normal suagrcane, due to its higher 
lipid content and research investment. Th e uncertainties 
in biomass yield of the lipid-cane would also infl uence 
its price. Th e lower biomass yield would probably cause 
the increase of lipid-cane price to balance farmer’s 
income. However, it would also be very possible that 
biomass might increase due to the synergy eff ect of lipid 
accumulation and carbon assimilation20, 50 and current 
research on photosynthesis improvements of crops.51 
Th erefore, a larage variation of lipid-cane price ($25 to 
$45/MT) was selected for sensivitiy analysis. As the cane 
price variates between $25/MT and $45/MT, the biodiesel 
production costs change broadly between $0.57/liter and 
$0.95/liter. 
Besides the lipid-cane price, the lipid extraction effi  -
ciency is also of importance. Since the lipid-cane is a new 
engineered crop to produce lipid, there is a signifi cant 
unceratinty redarding extraction effi  ciency. Th erefore, a 
range of extraction effi  ciency from a low point (70%) to 
a high point (95%) was selected for sensitivity analysis. 
Interstingly, its infl uence was not as large as other vari-
ables, such as lipid-cane prices, annual operating days and 
annual cursh capacity. Th is is mainly because the unex-
tracted lipids were burned to produce electricity, which 
increased the coproduct credits. Furthermore, glycerol 
selling prices had little infl uence on the biodiesel produc-
tion costs. 
In the case of the soybean biodiesel process, the soy-
bean prices and soybean meals were the main targets for 
sensitivity analysis, since these two parameters had the 
largest infl uence on the biodiesel production cost. Both 
parameters are uncertain due to the large fl uctuations of 
marketing prices of soybean and soybean meals. In 2013, 
the monthly average prices for soybean fl uctuated between 
$470 and $560 per MT, and the monthly average prices 
for soybean meal fl uctuated between $450 and $520 per 
MT.52 By excluding the extreme prices, the soybean price 
between $490 and $550 per MT and the soybean meal 
price between $450 and $500 per MT were conducted for 
sensitivity analysis. Compared to the above two variables, 
other variables (i.e., soybean hull prices, glycerol price,  19321031, 2016, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bbb.1640 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [02/02/2024].

biodiesel production cost. 
Figure 7 shows the combined eff ect of parameter varia-
tions on the biodiesel production cost. Th e range of bio-
diesel production cost for both cases were wide because of 
the uncertainty in these variables. Th e wide range of the 
estimated cost could become narrow as technology devel-
ops, because some varibales would become consistent, 
such as lipid extraction effi  ciency. However, some param-
eters, such as soybean price, remain uncertain, since they 
are more market-driven. 
Biofuel yield per unit land area
Th ough it is important to understand the biofuel produc-
tion costs and the IRR for the soybean and lipid-cane pro-
cesses, it is equally important to evaluate the amount of 
biofuel production from each hectare of land use because 
the limited land resource is one of the main barriers for 
the wide replacement of petroleum fuel with biofuel.

H Huang, S Long, V Singh Modeling and Analysis: Biodiesel and ethanol co-production from lipid-producing sugarcane

ern states of the USA (Florida, Louisiana, and Texas). 
In this study, the lipid-cane yield was assumed to be the 
same as that of conventional sugarcane at 110 MT/ha, 
with 70% moisture content. Using the biofuel yields from 
each MT of sugarcane and lipid-cane, the biofuel produc-
tion per hectare of land use can be determined. Figure 
8 shows that the biodiesel yield from soybeans is only 
approximately 500 liters per hectare of land use. For the 
lipid-cane, even with 2% lipid content, the biodiesel yield 
was already higher than that from soybean. Meanwhile, it 
can produce nearly 10 000 liters of ethanol by fermenting 
the remaining sugars. Upon increasing the lipid content 
from 2 to 20%, the biodiesel yield increases, where as the 
ethanol yield decreases because the sugar in the lipid-cane 
was replaced with the lipids. For the lipid-cane with 20% 
lipid content, planting lipid-cane on one hectare of land 
can produce more than 6700 liters of biodiesel, which 
is more than 10 times that of soybean. With such high 
biodiesel production from each hectare of land, it only 
needs about 0.76 Mha of land to meet the current US bio-
diesel requirement (5.1 billion liters). Given a total current 
managed farm land area of 370 Mha with an additional 
11 Mha in conservation reserve, 0.76 Mha is a realistic 
target.53
Conclusions
A techno-economic model of lipid-cane processes to pro-
duce ethanol and biodiesel was developed and compared 
with a soybean-based process model to assess lipid-cane’s 
economic competitiveness. By increasing the lipid content 
in lipid-cane from 2% to 20%, the biodiesel production 
costs decreased from $0.86/L to $0.59/L, which is lower 
than the production cost from soybeans, $1.08/L. Th e IRR 
values of the lipid-cane processes are dependent on the 
lipid content in lipid-cane: as lipid content increased from 
2 to 20%, the IRR values increased from 13.5 to 24.0%. 
Th erefore, it is important to increase the lipid content to 
make the lipid-cane more competitive. Due to its high pro-
ductivity, lipid-cane can produce more than 10 times the 
amount of biodiesel per hectare than soybeans. Overall, 
the techno-economic model shows that lipid-cane could be 
a promising alternative feedstock for biodiesel and ethanol 
production.
