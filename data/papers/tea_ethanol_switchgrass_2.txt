 Abstract  
 
Switchgrass (Alamo) was pretreated with phosphoric acid (0.75 and 1%, w/w) at three 
temperatures (160, 175 and 190 °C) and time (5, 7.5 and 10 min) using a steam gun. The slurry 
after pretreatment was liquefied by enzymes and the released sugars were ferme nted in a 
simultaneous saccharification and co -fermentation process to ethanol using ethanologenic 
Escherichia coli  strain SL100. Among the three variables in pretreatment , temperature and time 
were critical in supporting ethanol titer and yield. Enzyme hy drolysis significantly increased the 
concentration of furans in slurries, apparently due to release of furans bound to the solids. The 
highest ethanol titer of 21.2±0.3 g /L ethanol obtained at the pretreatment condition of 190 -1-7.5 
(temperature -acid conce ntration -time) and 10% solids loading account ed for 190±2.9 g ethanol  
/kg of raw switch grass . This converts to  61.7 gallons of ethanol per ton of dry switchgrass , a 
value that is comparable to other published pretreatment conditions .

 1.  Introduction  
World consumption of petroleum in 201 6 was 9 7 million barrels per day and this is projected to 
increas e at about 1.5% per year (US Energy Information Administratio n; EIA ). Even with new 
discovery of oil reservoirs, world economy is still dependent on limited number of fossil fuels 
exporting countries. Although several non -petroleum energy sources are available, transportation 
still depends on liquid fuels derived from petro leum. In 2016 , 88% of transportation energy in 
U.S.A. was derived from petroleum and this is about 70% of the total petroleum consumption  in 
the country (EIA) . Gasoline accounted for 55% of the total energy used by the transportation 
sector in U.S.A . and s upplementation of gasoline with renewable ethanol is expected to lower 
this demand on petroleum . Due to c oncerns of climate change, energy independence, f inite 
nature of oil, as well as economic security of the nation , developing sustainable sources of 
energy and products have become an immediate objective of several countries, including U.S.A. 
Renewable energy derived from biomass is  a substitute for fossil -based liquid transportation  fuel. 
Biomass includes  all photosynthetic material s and can be converted  to fuels, chemicals or power.  
Although petroleum is also derived  from biomass , fixation of CO 2 from the atmosphere to 
produce this biomass and its utilization as fuel today are separated by millions of years. This 
time differential in production of biomass and consumption of petroleum is the leading cause of 
current environmental concerns . By coupli ng production and consumption of biomass, a 
sustainable cyclic process with minimal environmental impact can be developed.  
Ethanol is a liquid fuel produced by fermentation of sugars (sugarcane or sugar beet) or 
starch in grain s of cereal crops. Due to its  relatively high octane number and high heat of 
vaporization , ethanol can be readily  blend ed with gasoline  (Hahn -Hagerdal et al., 2006) . In 
U.S.A ., corn is the dominant commercial feedstock of the ethanol industry that produces about 4 
 16 billion gallons per year (EIA) . As a food crop, grains used for ethanol produ ction competes 
with its primary use as food and feed  (Zilberman et al., 2013) . In addition, fertile land is removed 
from food production for fuel production  (Seyffarth, 2016) . To overcome these limitations and to 
expand biofuel production  to lower petroleum consumption , research is focused on 
lignocellulosic materials  as feedsto ck for bio fuel production in a sustainable way (Energy -EERE, 
2015; Lynd et al., 2017) . Energy crops grown in marginal lands appeal as additional  sources of 
biomass for biofuel production and switchgrass, a native plant of North America, appears to be 
the most promising herbaceous energy crop (Keshwani & Cheng, 2009; Wright & Turhollow, 
2010) . 
Lignocellulosic biomass contains sugars in  the form of cellulose and hemicellulose  that 
are embedded with lignin in a structurally rigid form  (Fengel &  Wegener, 1983) . Their natural 
function to bear high mechanical loads  and resist chemical and enzymatic degradation  is not 
compatible with its proposed use as feedstock for fuel production. Since industrially important 
microorganisms require monomeric s ugars or oligosaccharides (2 -4 sugar moieties) as feedstock 
for fermentation  to ethanol , the polysaccharides in the plant tissue need to be destabilized and 
converted to constituent sugars.  Several pretreatment strategies  have been described to disrupt  
the biomass structure to generate sugar monomers  (Tao et al., 2011) . Dilute acid at high 
temperature is one of the methods that effectively hydrolyzes hemicellulose while also rendering 
cellulose to enzyme hydrolysis  (Yang & Wyman, 2009) . Sulfuric acid , due to its low cost , is an 
intensely studied catalyst  for biomass pretreatment , although this process requires complex 
alloys to minimize corrosion of equipment in a biorefinery. Rel atively milder phosphoric acid  as 
a catalyst for biomass pretreatment not only lowers the cost of equipment but also reduces the 
amount of inhibitory compounds generated during pretreatment (Fontana et al., 1984; Geddes et 5 
 al., 2010) . Presence of inhibitors in the pretreatment slurry demand additional process steps to 
remove the inhibitors or microbial biocatalyst s that can metabolically convert the inhibitors to 
less inhibitory  form before growth and fermentation.    
A phosphoric acid based one pot fermentation process was developed and successfully 
evaluated using sugar cane and sorghum bagasses (Geddes et al., 2013) . This process utilized the 
entire slurry (solids and hydrolysate) from  pretreatment and after enzyme hydrolysis and SScF 
(L+SScF) with Escherichia  coli strain SL100 yielded an average of  275 g ethanol per kg of dry 
bagasse  (about 76% yield) . Phosphoric acid has also been used for pretreatment of corn stover  
and corn cob  (Avci et al., 2013a; Satimanont et al., 2012) . Under conditions that are optimized 
for each pretreatment of corn stover, the yield of ethanol from a phosphoric acid process was 26 
g/L at 10% loading and this was not dissimilar  to 30 g/L ethanol (300 g/kg of stover) yield from 
a sulfuric acid pretreatment process (Avci et al., 2013a; Avci et al., 2013b) . These studies show 
that phosphoric acid pretreatment of biomass followed by appropriate amount of enzymes can 
support  ethanol yields that are comparable to other pretreatment strategies  (Geddes et al., 2011) . 
An additional advantage of phosphoric acid pretreatment is that the residual acid in the slurry can 
serve as phosphate for growth of the fermenting microo rganism. Residual  phosphorus in the 
stillage can be recovered and used as a fertilizer for plant growth (Geddes et al., 2013; de 
Vasconcelos et al., 2013 ). In addition to being a microbial and plant nutrient, a dilute phosphoric 
acid and steam pretreatment eliminates the need for solvent recovery steps that are needed in 
other pretreatment s, such as , organosolv. With appropriate equipment, the pretreatment time and 
temperature can be lower with phosphoric acid pretreatment compared to autohydrol ysis of 
biomass (Kim et al., 2011) . These characteristics, along with lower inhibitor concentration in th e 
slurry from the phosphoric acid and steam pretreatment compared to sulfuric acid pretreatment 6 
 (Geddes et al., 2010) , support direc t utilization of the slurry  in a biorefinery  for fermentation to 
ethanol with enzyme hydrolysis  but without expensive separation and/or detoxification 
processes . This simple process is anticipated to lower both equipment and process costs in the 
biorefinery.  
Various pretreatment strategie s for swi tchgrass have been reported and t hese include 
sulfuric acid/steam, ammonia, base, ionic liquids, etc. (Kim et al., 2011; Papa et al., 2015) . Many 
of these pretreatment s are followed by additional steps of separation of solids  and liquids , 
removal of the chemicals used in pretreatment, etc.  In this study, a phosphoric acid based 
pretreatment of switchgrass modeled after a simplified process developed for sugar  cane bagasse  
(Geddes et al., 2013)  is described . This process from biomass to ethanol contains only  three 
steps; pretreatment with acid and steam, liquefaction with enzymes and SScF with ethanologenic 
E. coli  strain SL100. This is the first phosphoric acid based simplified process for switchgrass as 
a feedstock for production of ethanol that yielded about 190 g ethanol per kg of dry biomass.  
 
2. Materials and Methods  
2.1 Materials  
Switchgrass (Alamo) ( Panicum virgatum  L) grown in Virginia, USA was harvested in Fall 2015 , 
size reduced to about 1 inch,  and donated by Mr. Fred Circle (FDC enterprises, Inc.) for this 
study. The biomass with a dry weight of 89.28±0.57% was stored in sacks at room temperature 
in the UF Stan Mayfield Biorefinery. Enzyme Cellic CTec3 (230 FPU per ml) was provided by 
Novozymes  (Franklinton, NC ). Phosphoric acid, potassium hydroxide and other chemicals were 
from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA).  
2.2 Composition Analysis  7 
 Composition of samples of raw switchgrass, biomass solids obtained after pretreatment and 
fermentation w as determined  using a method developed by t he U.S. National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory (NREL method) (Sluiter et al., 2012) .  
2.3 Pretreatment  
Twenty kg of r aw switchgrass in 4 kg (dry weight ) batches were soaked in 56 kg of phosphoric 
acid solution at various concentrations (0, 0.75%, 1.0%; w /w) for 12 hours at room temperature. 
Phosphoric acid  was based on the amount mixed with water prior to adding switchgr ass and 
compensated for moisture in the biomass. Soaked switchgrass was dewatered using a CP -4 screw 
press (Vincent Corporation, Tampa, FL) to 30 -50% dry weight. Phosphoric acid impregnated  
and dewatered  biomass samples were combined, mixed , and separated into 500 g samples (dry 
weight) for steam treatment  as described previously (Geddes et al., 2011; Palmqvist et al., 1996) . 
The 500 g sample upon entry into the 10 L pressure chamber was rapidly heated by high pressure 
steam to the needed temperature (160, 175, 180, and 190  °C) and  held for the required time (5, 
7.5 and 10 min ). The time required to reach  190°C in the chamber was about 15 seconds while 
operating temperatures that are less than 190°C was reached in less than 5 seconds. At the end of 
pretreatment, the slurry was rapidly discharged into a bin at atmospheric pressure  and room 
temperature  (≤10 seconds). A total of 20 kg of switchgrass was processed under each 
pretreatment condition in several batches. Pretreated biomass samples (slurry) from all the 
batches were pooled, mixed and stored at 4°C.  
2.4 Characterization of the p retreated switchgrass  
For deter mination of water insoluble solid (WIS), 5g of pretreated biomass slurry was washed 
with 4L of deionized water using a Whatman Qualitative Filter Paper at a pore size 2 .5 μm under 8 
 vacuum  to remove all the solubles, including free sugars and inhibitors . The solid residue was 
dried to constant weight  before analysis .  
For determination of the composition of the hydrolysate, about  10-15 g of pretreated 
biomass slurry was pressed with RA Chand J210 manual citrus juicer. The pass -through was 
centr ifuged for 12 minutes at 600 x g and the  supernatant (hydrolysate) was used for 
determination of pH, density, conductivity, dry weight and composition of the hydrolysate.  
To determine the composition of the slurry, a sample was dried at 60°C to constant 
weight. The dried sample was cut and passed through a sieve with 0.841 mm opening  before 
analysis .  
2.5 Liquefaction of the  Slurry  
Commercial cellulase (Cellic CTec3 ; 230 FPU/ml ) was added at the desired concentration to a 
well-mixed sample of slurry (10% solids, w/v) at pH 5.0 (adjusted with NH 4OH) and the 
carbohydrates were  partially saccharified ( liquefied ) with 11.5 FPU/g dry biomass at 50°C for 6 
h at the optimum temperature and pH  for the enzymes  (Application Sheet for Cellic CTec3 from 
Novozymes) , as before for sugar  cane bagasse slurry (Geddes et al., 2011)  to improve mixing of 
the slurry .  
2.6 Detoxification of Pretreated Slurry  
The slurry from 190-1-7.5 pretreatment condition was not fermented by E. coli  strain SL100 
when the solids concentration was increased to 15% due to a concomitant increase in inhibitors. 
The slurry from this pretreatment condition was detoxified to remove some of the inhibitory 
compounds  to aid growth and fermentation of strain SL100 . For detoxification , pH of the slurry 
was adjusted to 9.0 with NH 4OH and incubated for 12 hours at 4 °C as described previously 9 
 (Geddes et al., 2013) . During this incubation period, pH of the sample decreased to about 7.0 . 
This slurry was used as detoxified material for L+SScF to ethanol.    
2.7 Microbial biocatalyst and growth conditions  
Ethanologenic E. coli  strain SL100 with higher level of tolerance to inhibitors in sugar cane 
bagasse hydrolysate  was described previously (Geddes et al., 2013) . Strain SL100 can grow and 
ferment in mineral salts  medium containing up to 50% of sugar cane bagass e hydrolysate (about 
1.0 g/L of furfural). The growth medium used was mineral salts medium AM1 (Martinez et al., 
2007) . Seed cultures for SScF were grown in AM1 medium with 60% switchgrass hydrolysate 
from a pretreatment con dition of 180 -1-10 (filtered and filter sterilized) for 20 hours at 37°C 
with 0.01 vvm aeration and pH control at 6.3 with 5N NH 4OH. This hydrolysate medium 
contain ing 17.6 g/L of total sugars and 0.6 g/L of furans  was used for growing strain SL100 
since this allowed adaptation of the ethanologen to switchgrass slurry. After 20 h of growth  to a 
cell dry weight of 1.7 g/L , all the sugars were fermented to an ethanol titer of 4.9 g/L.   
Fermentations were conducted in BioFlo 110 fermenters  (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY ) 
using a 3L vessel with 2L working volume (37oC, 200 rpm). Liquefied slurry (10% solids  
content ) in AM1 medium at pH 6.3 was supplemented with sodium meta -bisulfite (SMB, 2M) 
before inoculation  to lower the t oxicity (Alriksson et al., 2011; Nieves et al., 2011a) . 
Fermentations were started with 200 ml of seed culture. Cell density at the start of SScF was 
0.17 g/L . After inoculation , the culture  at 37°C was aerated at 0.01 vvm (20 ml/min) to increase 
the growth rate and support  rapid metabolic removal  of inhibitors in the slurry  (Nieves et al., 
2011b) . Fermentation pH was maintained at 6.3 by automatic addition of 5N NH 4OH. Growth of 
the culture and fermentation profile were monitored for 96 hours. Concentration of sugars, 
ethanol and co -products in the medium  were determined and normalized to the starting culture 10 
 volume of 2L after adjustment for volume change due to sample withdrawal and base addition. 
Fermentations were conducted in triplicate and the mean and sta ndard deviation were calculated 
from the fermentations profiles.  
2.8 Analytical methods  
Dry weight was determined using a moisture analyzer (Kern model MLB 50 –3; Balingen, 
Germany). Hydrolysate composition was determined by HPLC (Agilent Technologies 1260 with 
refractive index detector ). Sugars were separated using Aminex HPX -87P ion exclusion column 
(300x7.8 mm ; Bio -Rad, Hercules, CA ) fitted with Carbo -Ca 4 guard column (4x3 mm ; 
Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) operating at 80°C with water as the mobile phase (0.6 ml/min). 
Organic acids and furans were determined by HPLC (Agilent Technologies 1260 HPLC 
equipped with UV and refractive index  detecters,  in series) with Aminex HPX - 87H column 
(Bio-Rad; 45 °C; 4 mM H2SO4 as the mobile phase , 0.4 ml/min flow rate). Ethanol was 
determined by GC as described before using an Agilent Technologies 6890N gas chromatograph  
(Geddes, et al., 2010).  
 
3. Results and Discussion  
The Alamo switchgrass  as received had a dry weight of 89%. The switchgrass had a total 
carbohydrate content of 64% with glucan, xylan and arabinan accounting for 38, 22 and 4 % of 
the dry weight of the biomass, respectively. This carbohydrate content translates to 716.4 g 
fermentable monomeric s ugars per kg of dry switchgrass that can yield a theoretical amount of 
365 g ethanol per kg of dry biomass. Soluble and insoluble lignin content of switchgrass w as 5 11 
 and 23% , respectively , while the  ash content was 1.6 %. Except for the ash  content, these values 
are comparable to the published values for various switchgrass  cultivars (Hu et al., 2010) .  
3.1 Pretreatment   
Phosphoric acid was used as the catalyst for pretreatment of switchgrass with high pressure 
steam  as described for sugar  cane bagasse (Geddes et al., 2011)  and in the Methods section . 
Slurry obtained after pretreatment contained both fibrous solids and liquid hydrolysate. Total 
sugar s released during pretreatment and present in the hydrolysate varied from 15 to 72 g per kg 
of biomass depending on the condition (Table 1) . A line ar relationship was observed between  
temperature (acid concentration , 0.75% ; residence time,  5 min ) and the amount of xylose and 
total sugar s released during pretreatment. Similar linear relationship of temperature and total 
sugar release was also reported  for phosphoric acid pretreatment of sugar cane bagasse  (Geddes 
et al., 2011) . However, the amount of sugar re leased from sugar cane bagasse was about 3-times 
higher than from switchgrass  at similar pretreatment condition  suggesting the hardiness of 
switchgrass compared to sugar cane bagasse. Similar less efficient hydrolysis of switchgrass to 
glucose compared to corn stover was also reported by Serate et al. (Serate et al., 2015) . In 
agreement with this hardiness of switchgrass, Avci, et al. reported that corn stover pretreatment 
condition of 160 -1-10 (temperature -acid concentration -time) with phosphoric acid hydrolyzed 
about 95  % of hemicellulose and the total sugar yield after pre treatment was 218.4 g per kg of 
dry corn stover (Avci et al., 2013a) . Compared to a total sugar yield from switchgrass at 160 -1-
7.5 of only 34 g/kg biomass (Table 1), sugar yiel d from corn stover was about 7 -times higher 
than from switchgrass. Pretreatment of switchgrass using sulfuric acid (160-0.5-10) as the 
catalyst  did hydrolyze about 80 -90% of hemicellulose compared to only about 10% of 12 
 hemicellulose hydrolysis during phosph oric acid pretreatment (160-1-7.5) (Table 1) confirming 
the milder nature of phosphoric acid (Kim et al., 2011) . 
Due to the narrow range of acid concentration and time of pretreatment used in this study , 
selected from  previous studies on sugar cane bagasse (Geddes et al., 2011; Geddes et al., 2010) , 
these two variables had no significant effect on hydrolysis of carbohydrates . Among the various 
pretreatment conditions tested in this study, the highest amount of sugars released was at 190 -1-
7.5 accounting for about 5 2.8±2.0  g xylose per kg of switchgrass (about 21% of hemicellulose)  
(Table 1) . The hydrolysate from this pretreatment condition also c ontained about 4 g furfural and 
1.4 g hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) to a total of 5.3 g furans per kg of switchgrass  (Table 2). 
This is in agreement with  reported positive correlation between pretreatment temperature and 
the concentration of sugar and inhibitor s in the slurry of  phosphoric acid pretreated sugar  cane 
bagasse (Geddes et al., 2011) . In addition, acetate and formate were also present in the 
hydrolysates.  
3.2 Solids Content after pretreatment  
With these pretreatment conditions, water insoluble solids correspondingly decreased as more 
sugars are released from the biomass , primarily due to hydrolysis of hemicellulos e with xylose as 
the dominant free sugar. This is also seen as a chan ge in the composition of biomass solids after 
pretreatment  (Fig. 1) . In addition to a decrease in hemicellulose, soluble lignin also decreased 
with increasing severity of pretreatment . These results are similar to decrease in hemicellulose in 
water insolub le solids  reported with phosphoric acid treated bagasse or sulfuric acid treated 
switchgrass (Geddes et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2009) .  
3.3 Liquefaction  13 
 Since the slurry contained both fibrous solids and hydrolysate, it was difficult to mix the slurry 
even at 10% solids loading  for simultaneous saccharification and co -fermentation (SScF) . A 
short period of cellul ase treatment (6 h) reduced  the average particle size of solids and improved 
mixing of the slurry during SScF  (L+SScF) (Geddes et al., 2013) . In order to establish an 
optimum concentration of Cellic CTec3 for liquefaction and further SScF, slurry from the 
pretreatment  condition of 190 -1-7.5 was treated with various enzyme concentrations (3.45 to 
17.25 FPU p er g dry biomass ; 1.5-7.5%, v/w ) for 6 hours at the optimum condition for Cellic 
CTec3  (50°C; pH 5.0) . The  amount of glucose, xylose and arabinose released during this 
liquefaction step was determined (Fig. 2 ). Glucose concentration in the slurry increased with 
increasing enzyme concentration until the enzyme activity reached about 11.5 FPU / g dry 
biomass. Further increase in the enzyme concentration had no significant  effect on cellulose 
hydrolysis to glucose. An enzym e concentration of 11. 5 FPU per g biomass was used to saturate 
hydrolysis of cellulose, the primary carbohydrate in switchgrass . The highest amount of glucose 
released during 6 hours of enzyme hydrolysis with 1 1.5 FPU per g biomass at this pretreatment 
was 154.8±5.3 g/kg biomass. Total glucose in the slurry at the end of liquefaction accounted for 
39% of cellulose ( 164.2 ±1.4 g/kg of biomass) with about 9 5% from enzyme hydrolysis  (Table 
1).  
 This liquefaction step also increased xylose concentration in the slurry indicating the 
presence of hemicellulose hydrolyzing activity in the enzyme mixture (Fig. 2). In contrast to 
glucose release, xylose release during liquefaction saturated at about 7 .5 FPU/g switchgrass. 
Increasing the enzyme concentration beyond this level only led to very small increase in free 
xylose (about 10 g/kg) in the slurry.  Although about 20% of hemicellulose was hydrolyzed 
during the 190 -1-7.5 pretreatment step, enzyme hydro lysis increased this to a total xylose yield 14 
 of 56%. About 65% of the xylose in the slurry at the end of liquefaction was generated during 
the liquefaction step.  Arabinose concentration in the slurry at the end of liquefaction was less 
than 20 g /kg switchg rass. Among the various pretreatment conditions  tested in this study, 1% 
acid gave the highest total sugar yield of about 0.46 ( 328.24±7 g/kg biomass ) of the theoretical 
value  (Table 1) .  
3.4 Furfural and HMF  
Although phosphoric a cid pretreatment is milder than sulfuric acid  pretreatment , microbial 
growth inhibitors, such as furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural , etc. , are still generated during 
pretreatment of biomass (Geddes et al., 2010; Zaldivar et al., 1999; Zha et al., 2014) . Similar 
results were also obtained with switchgrass  treated with sulfuric acid (Djioleu & Carrier, 2016) . 
Concentration  of furans in the hydrolysate from the slurry was dependent on the severity of 
phosphoric acid pretreatment (0.3 -5.3 g/kg of switchgrass) with 190 -1-7.5 generating the highest 
amount (Table 2). However, the furan content of the liquid fraction of the slurries increased in all 
pretreatment condition s after liquefaction with enzymes  (Table 2). For example, furan content of 
hydrolysates from al l pretreatments at 175°C, was about 2 g of furans /kg of biomass irrespective 
of the time or acid concentration. The furan content of the same samples after liquefaction for 6 
hours with 11.5 FPU cellulase activity  (per g biomass)  increased to an average o f 5.0 (4.3 -6.2) 
g/kg of biomass. T his increase was also dependent on the pretreatment temperature (Fig. 3). It is 
unlikely that the liquefaction step at pH 5.0 and 50 °C for 6 h generated additional furans by 
dehydrating sugars. Apparently, this increase is  due to release of furans generated during 
pretreatment step from the solids  fraction  in the slurry to the liquid fraction as the carbohydrates 
were hydrolyzed by the enzymes. This may reflect the fraction termed as pseudo -lignin 
generated during acid -based pretreatment of carbohydrates in biomass (Hu et al., 2013; Kumar et 15 
 al., 2013) . Hemicellulose (xylan) -derived -pseudo -lignin has be en reported to form at even 
moderate severities of pretreatment as the case with phosphoric acid pretreatment at 160 -0.75-5. 
This increase in furans used as an indicator here suggests that the concentration of other 
inhibitors also increased after liquefaction. Due to large differences in pretreatment conditions, it 
is difficult to compare the furan c ontent of switchgrass slurry from this study to other values in 
the literature.  
 Increase in acetate concentration after liquefaction is expected due to hemicellulose 
hydrolysis while formate concentration actually decreased  at this step  (Table 2) .  
3.5 Simultaneous saccharification and co -fermentation (SScF)  
The pH of the slurries after liquefaction at 50 °C was raised from 5.0 to 6.3 with NH 4OH and the 
sugars were fermented to ethanol using an ethanologenic E. coli  strain SL100. Strain SL100 
ferments bot h hexoses and pentoses to ethanol simultaneously (Geddes et al., 2013) . 
Temperature of SScF was 37°C, the optimum for E. coli  strain SL100. Although this temperature 
is not optimum for fungal cellulase activity, the enzymes contin ued to be active at this 
temperature at a lower level compared to the activity at the optimum temperature of 50 °C (Patel 
et al., 2005) . This continued activity of the enzymes is expected to release additional sugars that 
are also fermented to ethanol.  
 A typical fermentation profile is presented in Fig. 4A. The liquefied slurry from a 
pretreatment condition of 1 75-1-7.5 contained glucose,  xylose and arabinose at 122.2±4.3, 
113.0±1.3 and 10.5±1.1 g/kg switchgrass, respectively , for a total sugar content of 245.6 ±11.3 
g/kg dry switchgrass  (Table 1) . This slurry also contained f urfural and HMF at a c oncentration of 
3.0±0.2 and 1.3±0.3 g/kg of  switchgrass, respectively  (Table 2) . At 10% solids loading, all the 
glucose was fermented during the first 24 h. Fermentation of xylose was complete in about 48 h. 16 
 There was no significant increase in ethanol after 48 h and the titer reached 17.2±0.01  g/L and 
the ethanol yield was 154.8±0.03 g /kg of dry switchgrass  (Table 3) . Furfural (0.37±0.07 g/L) and 
HMF (0.16±0.04 g/L) in the starting slurry were not detectable at 24 h. B ased on the amount of 
carbohydrates in the solids  after fermentation , a total of 396 g  of fermentable sugars (per kg of 
switchgrass ) was released by pretreatment (175 -1-7.5) and enzyme hydrolysis , and 150 g  (per kg 
biomass) of this total was released during SScF  by the enzymes carried over from the 
liquefaction step . In add ition to eth anol, small amount of acetate and lactate were also detected in 
the broth.  Yield of ethanol for this pretreatment condition was 42% of the total carbohydrates in 
the biomass and 77% of the amount of released sugars.  
 Increasing the temperature of pretreatment to  190°C keeping the acid concentration and 
time the same (190 -1-7.5) yielded the highest amount of total sugars (Table 1) . However, this  
pretreatment condition  also generated the highest amount of furans  (5.3 g/kg of biomass) before 
liquefaction  (Table 2 ; Fig. 3 ). Even a t 10% solid s loading, furfural (0.71±0.03 g/L) and HMF 
(0.12±0.02 g/L) were present in the slurry at growth inhibitory concentration for strain SL100. It 
took 48 h for strain SL100 to completely detoxify the furfural in the slurry  (Fig. 4B). Due to the 
presence of fur fural, growth and glucose fermentation w ere minimal during the first 24 h and a 
slight increase in glucose concentration in the medium at 24 h was due to continued hydrolysis of 
cellulose by the enzymes . After about a 20 h lag, glucose fermentation was linear until all the 
glucose was fermented by 72 h. At the end of th is experiment (96 h), about 4.5 g/L xylose was 
left unfermented  in addition to about 3 g/L of galactose . At this pretreatment, ethanol titer was 
21.2±0.3 g/L and ethanol  yield  was 190.4±2.9 g/kg of dry switchgrass. Yield of ethanol on the 
basis of total carbohydrates in the switchgrass  was 52% , a slight increase over the values from 
the 175°C pretreatment.  17 
 Increasing the severity of pretreatment further is expected to  increase the concentration of 
inhibitors and prolong the lag period before growth and fermentation of total slurry start even 
with furfural tolerant E. coli  strain SL100 . Similar lag before fermentation due to furans present 
in unfractionate d phosphoric acid treated corn stover hydrolysate was also reported for another 
ethanologenic E. coli  (strain FBR5) (Avci et al., 2013a) . A combination of longer liquefaction 
time and SScF at a higher temperature that favors enzyme hydrolysis using a thermotolerant 
microbial biocatalyst could improve the yield of ethanol from switchgrass without the need for 
increasing the severity of pretreatment. Increasing the fermentation tim e beyond 96 h is another 
opportunity to increase ethanol titer without solids/liquids separation and/or detoxification of the 
slurry, both requiring additional process steps.   
3.6 Effect of enzyme concentration on L+SScF  of switchgrass slurry  
Since enzymes play a critical role in carbohydrate hydrolysis, it is expected that the 
ethanol titer and yield are dependent on enzyme concentration , a significant cost component of 
cellulosic ethanol production (Gubiczaa et al., 2016; Lynd et al., 2017) . As described above, 
yield of sugar s increased with increasing enzyme concentration with the slurry from 190 -1-7.5 
and saturated at about 11.5 FPU cellulase of Ce llic CTec3 per g biomass (Fig. 2 ). As expected, 
ethanol titer also saturated at this enzyme concentration. When the enzyme concent ration at the 
liquefaction step was increased from 11.5 to 17.25 FPU/g biomass, the ethanol titer only 
increased by 1. 4 g/L from 21.2±0.32 to 22. 6±0.04 g/L (Fig. 4). The ethanol yield fraction based 
on the amount of sugars fermented at these enzyme concent rations averaged to 0.77±0.1 . For  all 
pretreatment  condition s and at the enzyme concentration  of 11.5 FPU/g biomass, the ethanol 
yield on the fermented sugars basis was 0.85 ±0.005 . Taking into account this conversion 18 
 efficiency of sugars to  ethanol, the yi eld of ethanol at a pretreatment of 190 -1-7.5 and 11.5 FPU 
/g biomass enzyme loading was 61% of the theoretical value.  
3.7 Fermentation at higher solids content  
To increase the ethanol titer in fermentations  with a goal of improving energy efficiency during 
distillation , solids content was increased from 10% to 15%. Since the slurry was used directly in 
these fermentations, the concentration of inhibitors also increased  to 1.25 g/L of furans (furfural 
+HMF) f rom 0.83 g/L  at the 10% solids loading . It should be noted that in addition to furans the 
slurry contains several other inhibitory compounds at various concentrations. These chemicals 
act synergistically to control bacterial growth. Strain SL100 did not gr ow or ferment the sugars 
in the slurry at 15% solids content  due to the inhibitors . Upon detoxification as described in the 
Methods section, the slurry was fermented to ethanol but the ethanol content of the broth was 
22.57 g/L, a 1.32 g/L increase over th e titer at 10% solids loading. This is apparently due to poor 
mixing of enzymes with solids as seen by the release  of about 300 g total sugars /kg of biomass 
at 15% solids content compared to about 420 g total sugars /kg of biomass at 10% solids loading. 
Non-productive binding of cellulases with lignin at higher solids loading is another possibility 
for lower sugar yield . These results suggest that further improvement in ethanol titer can be 
achieved by  reducing particle size for better mixing of the solids with enzymes combined with 
removal of inhibitory compounds from the slurry by detoxification. These a dditional proce ss 
steps , although beneficial,  are anticipated to  add to  the production cost of product, ethanol .   
3.8 Mass balance  
The solids remaining after pretreatment and L+SScF accounted for 4 8 to 68% of switchgrass 
based on the pretreatment condition (Table 4). An average of 94% of lignin in the starting 
switchgrass was recovered in the solids from all pretreatments after L+SScF. T he carbohydrate 19 
 content of the solids varied from 31 to 57%  with the lower value from more severe pretreatment 
condition while the higher value from less severe pretreatment. At the end of 6+96 hours of 
L+SScF, all the released sugars in the slurries were fermented for most of the pretreatment 
conditions except for th ree of the most severe pretreatment conditions tested (175 -1-10, 190 -
0.75-5 and 190 -1-7.5). With these three pretreatment conditions, about 45 -50 g sugars per kg of 
biomass , mostly pentoses,  remained unfermented at the end of 96 h (Table 5) . This is appare ntly 
due to the lag before growth of strain SL100 started, resulting from  higher concentration of 
inhibitors generated during the three pretreatment conditions. Based on the fermentation profile, 
remaining sugars  at the end of 96 hours of SScF , lignin and ash, a mass balance of 94 to 100 % 
of starting biomass was recovered in these pretreatment conditions  (Table 5).  
 Various pretreatment conditions, such as AFEX, dilute acid (H 2SO 4), hot water or base 
(NH 4OH), we re employed for switchgrass and the ethanol titer and yield from these studies can 
be found in e -version of this paper online . In these studies, pretreated slurries were further 
processed (solids/liquid separation, etc.) and the released sugars in hydrolys ates or from solids 
alone  after enzyme hydrolysis were fermented. Among the various processes tested, AFEX 
pretreatment led to highest ethanol titer and yield. The reported ethanol titers of dilute acid 
processes were comparable to that of the phosphoric acid process described in this s tudy 
although additional process steps were employed in these studies. It may be necessary to 
minimize the process complexity to lower the final cost of ethanol produced from biomass  
(Gubiczaa et al., 2016) . The three step process described here (Fig. 5) based on the L+SScF 
process deve loped for sugar cane bagasse (Geddes et al., 2013)  using phosphoric acid has the 
potential for cost-effective conversion of switchgr ass to fuels and chemicals.  
4. Conclusion  20 
  A simplified three step process for processing switchgrass to ethanol was adapted from 
that of sugarcane bagasse (Fig. 5) (Geddes et al., 2013) . Switc hgrass  was pretreated with 
phosphoric acid and high-pressure steam. Entire slurry without removing any of the components 
was liquefied with enzymes and f erment ed by an ethanologenic E. coli . Enzyme s required for 
optimal release of sugars during L+SScF  was about 12 FPU/g biomass. At this enzyme loading 
and a pretreatment condition of 190 -1-7.5, the ethanol titer was 21.2±0.32 g/L at a solids loading 
of 10% (w/v) and the ethanol yield was 190.4±2.92 g per kg of dry switchgrass .
