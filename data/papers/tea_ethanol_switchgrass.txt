Three crops of warm-season grasses are being developed for b iomass production on
northern rain-fed marginal farmland: big bluestem (BBS), s witchgrass (SG), and a low

INTRODUCTION
Perennial warm-season (C4) grasses have been proposed as a
sustainable resource for producing sugars, chemicals, and f uels
using thermo-chemical and biochemical processes. The U.S.
has suﬃcient resources to grow an estimated 171 Tg yr−1
of biomass from bioenergy grasses by 2022 ( Turhollow et al.,
2014). Perennial warm-season grasses are favored for biomass
production because of their high productivities and low input
requirements. In the case of switchgrass (SG, Panicum virgatum
L.),ithasbeencalculatedthatitsconversiontofuelethan olwould
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 94% compared to gasoline,
andthebioethanolwouldhaveatotalnetenergybalanceof54 0%
(Schmeretal.,2008 ).Perennial,warmseasongrassesareidealfor
inclusion in rainfed systems with variable precipitation bec ause
of their high water use eﬃciency and developed deep rooting
systems which also serve to stabilize and improve soil quality
(Liebig et al., 2008; Blanco-Canqui et al., 2017 ). They are also
nutrient-useeﬃcientbecausenitrogenandessentialeleme ntsare
translocated to the soil, roots, and rhizomes during and aft er
senescence( Vogeletal.,2002;Mulkeyetal.,2008 ).
The United States Department of Agriculture has an ongoing
long-term project to develop biomass varieties of native prai rie
grasses for growth on marginal lands in the Great Plains and
UpperMidwest( Andersonetal.,2016 ).Developmentofsuitable
cultivars is particularly diﬃcult because they need to perfor m
well on marginal (e.g., low productivity, high erosion potent ial,
low proﬁtability) rain-fed farmland to minimize land use
change from growing row crops. Therefore, in addition to high
production, other important traits include drought resistan ce,
quick,anddependableestablishment,resistancetolodging , low-
nutrient demands, resistance to pathogens and insects, and
high winter survival rates (e.g., over-wintering) ( Sarath et al.,
2008). Breeding and management research requires a long-term
commitment because of the need to study establishment and
multiple production years on these traits. U.S.D.A., through i ts
northern bioenergy centers, is developing and evaluating th ree
native prairie-based bioenergy cropping systems: switchgras s,
big bluestem ( Andropogon gerardii Vitman), and a low-diversity
grassmixture( Andersonetal.,2016 ).
Of these perennial bioenergy crops, SG is perhaps the most
highly developed as judged by past ﬁeld studies ( McLaughlin
andKszos,2005;Moore etal.,2014 ),availablebiomasscultivars,
traditional, and molecular breeding research ( Lipka et al., 2014;
Vogel et al., 2014; Biswal et al., 2018 ), and other available tools
(e.g.,NIRcalibrations)( Vogeletal.,2011;Serapigliaetal.,2017 ).
Big bluestem (BBS) is a bioenergy crop of growing interest
because of its high productivity, good genetic diversity, an d
ecological role as the dominant prairie species ( Moore et al.,
2014;Zhangetal.,2015 ).YetdevelopmentofBBSasabioenergy
crop has lagged considerably behind that of SG ( Zhang et al.,
2015). Finally,there is interest in cultivatingpastures contai ning
multiplespeciestoemulatenaturalprairiesforpossibleecolog ical
beneﬁts ( Tilman et al., 2006 ). However, it is a challenge to
develop a mixture of grasses that maintains both diversity a nd
high production over multiple years and cuttings. The crops
selected here represent a signiﬁcant advance over previouslycultivated grasses. For example, Liberty SwitchgrassTMis the
ﬁrst bioenergy developed variety released by the USDA ( Vogel
et al., 2014 ), following a long breeding and selection process
for high productivity and good over-wintering survival, and is
only presently being evaluated in commercially relevant ﬁeld
plots. Likewise, the BBS crop used for this study is a mixture
of two cultivars to maximize yield and stand health. There
is also a need for further testing of polyculture plantings of
grassesforbioenergyproductiongiventhesparsityofpaststu dies
usingdeﬁnedgrassmixturesinverylimitedgeographicalgro wth
regions (Robertson et al., 2017 ). Here, we describe a relevant
mixture of grasses based on established high production gras ses
amenable to cutting and processing to value-added products.
This unique low diversity mixture (LDM) is comprised of BBS,
indiangrass ( Sorghastrum nutans (L.) Nash), and sideoats grama
[Boutelouacurtipendula (Michx.)Torr.].
Each has shown good establishment and persistence in
production ﬁelds located on marginal rain-fed farmland locat ed
in northeastern Nebraska ( Blanco-Canqui et al., 2017 ). Earlier
research established that all three crops were equally beneﬁc ial
forimprovingsoilquality( Blanco-Canquietal.,2017 ).

of a bioenergy crop depends on more than solely crop yield.
This study evaluates the performance of these three promising
bioenergycropsforpre-processingandbioconversiontoethan ol.
Amajorimpedimenttousingherbaceousbioenergycropsfor
industrial-scaled bioconversion is solving the logistica l supply
challenge of getting the biomass to the bioreﬁnery gate ( Hansen
et al., 2015 ). Bioreﬁneries are projected to be very large and
to require considerable quantities of biomass to operate at
cost-eﬀective scales. For example, U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE) cellulosic ethanol cost estimates are based upon a
plant consuming 2,000 metric ton/day ( Humbird et al., 2011 ).
Meanwhile,choppedorbaledgrassisdiﬃculttostore,transport ,
and process on the front end because it has low-bulk density
and poor ﬂow properties. This challenge can be addressed
by densifying and reforming the biomass. There are several
availablemethodsfordensifyingandreformingbiomassofw hich
the pellet mill and briquette press are the most popular that
are compatible with biochemical conversion ( Tumuluru et al.,
2011). A pellet mill has several advantages in terms of low
machine maintenance, eﬃcient, and eﬀective densiﬁcation, an d
pellets have better handling properties compared to briquettes

switchgrass ( Rijal et al., 2012; Wolfrum et al., 2017 ), or post-
harvest created mixes of biomass ( Shi et al., 2013; Wolfrum
et al., 2017 ). Two of these studies pelletized corn stover with
ammonium ﬁber expansion (AFEX) pre-treatment ( Bals et al.,
2014; Hoover et al., 2014 ). Other studies used a conventional
pelletizingprocessfollowedbyeitherpre-treatmentswithdi lute-
acid (Rijal et al., 2012; Ray et al., 2013; Wolfrum et al., 2017 ),
ionic liquids ( Shi et al., 2013 ), or ammonium hydroxide at room
temperature ( Rijal et al., 2012 ). Much of the literature concerns
theinﬂuenceofpelletsonchemicalcompositionandbiochemic al

involves heating and high-pressure steps likely to alter the
chemical and certainly the physical nature of the biomass ( Stelte
et al., 2012 ). Results from compositional analyses are somewhat
mixed with studies reporting either no eﬀect by pelletization

vs. non-pellets. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study that we
are aware of to process bioenergy crops using a commercial-

Pre-treatment is the heart of the ethanol production process
and is among its most expensive unit operations ( Lynd et al.,
2017). We have chosen to compare the crops using two pre-
treatmenttechniques:liquidhotwater(LHW)andlow-moist ure
ammonium hydroxide (LMA). Liquid hot-water, as its name
implies, reacts biomass in the presence of hot-water (e.g., 18 0–
200◦C) (Mosier et al., 2005a ). It has been a popular choice in
the literature because it combines some of the advantages of
an acid catalyzed pre-treatment without the disadvantages o f
using a mineral acid ( Mosier et al., 2005b ). It also generally
produces lower amounts of inhibitors compared to dilute-acid
pre-treatment. LMA is relatively new and involves treating lo w-
moisturebiomasswithammoniumhydroxide( Kimetal.,2016 ).
It is of interest because it employs a static reactor and does n ot
require a dewatering step. We included both pre-treatments to
evaluate the biomass samples using both acid and base based
pre-treatments.
To summarize, in this study established production ﬁelds of
BBS, LDM, and SG were harvested, ﬁeld dried, and formed into
round bales. Biomass yields for BBS, LDM, and SG were 7.4,
9.4, and 9.6 Mg/ha, respectively. The bales were transported
to a nearby alfalfa feed operation and converted into pellets.These pellets were characterized for bulk density and chemical
composition. Ground and pelletized biomasses were pre-treated
with LHW and LMA. LHW pre-treated samples were evaluated

for conversion to sugars and ethanol, the latter using a yeast
that is capable of fermenting both glucose and xylose. The goal
was to determine which crop(s) is most suited as a feedstock for
bioethanolproduction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and Media
All media and chemicals were research grade and purchased
from either Fisher Scientiﬁc or Sigma Aldrich Chemicals.
The enzymes used were commercial formulations of cellulases
(140mgprotein/mlCTEC3,NovozymesInc.)andhemicellulase s
(HTEC2, 109mg protein/ml). Enzyme activities were measured
using previously reported methods ( Dien et al., 2008 ). The yeast
Scheﬀersomycesstipitis Y-50871(ARSCultureCollection,Peoria,
IL) was used for fermentations. This strain has been extensi vely
evolved and selected for ethanol fermentation of glucose/xy lose
sugars prepared from alkaline pre-treated biomass ( Slininger
etal.,2015 ).
Biomass Samples and Pelletizing

Approximately 18Mg of each feedstock was coarsely ground
and pelletized by our commercial partner Dehy Alfalfa Mills
(Lyons, NE). Large amounts of each biomass were processed to

bales were transported to the plant where they were sequential ly

was dried in a ring drier, steam conditioned, and pelletized
using a ring die pellet mill ( Figure1). The pellet mill settings
were ¼” (6.35mm) pellet diameter with a length of 3/8” −1 1/4”
(9.525–31.75mm).

Moisture contents were measured by monitoring weight loss
after samples had been dried at 105◦C for 18h. Chemical
composition of water/ethanol extracts, structural carbohy drates,
and lignin analysis was conducted using the two-stage acid
digestion method ( Sluiter et al., 2008 ). Soluble sugars (sucrose,
glucose, and fructose) and starch were measured as previouslyreported ( Dien et al., 2006 ). Each sample was analyzed in
duplicate.
Pre-treatments
LHW pre-treatments were conducted as previously described
(Serapiglia et al., 2017 ). Brieﬂy, milled samples were pre-treated
at 10% w/w solids in sealed serum bottles. Serum bottles (2 ea .)
were placed in stainless steel reactors, which were ﬁtted int o an
infrared reactor system and heated to 190◦C for 15min before
beingwater-cooledto40◦C.Reactorswereheatedat2.5◦C/min.
LMA pre-treatments were conducted as follows. Milled
biomass(6.0gdrybasis)andconcentratedammoniumhydroxi de
solution (4.9ml of 28%w/w ammonia content) were placed in
a steel mini-reactor and immediately sealed with a screw cap
steel lid. The reactor was mixed at 30◦C for 40min at 6 rpm
(clockwise followed by counter-clockwise) using a computer
controlled infra-red reactor system (Mathis Labomat model
BFA12,Switzerland).Oncemixed,thereactorwasplaceduprig ht

reactor was removed from the oven, allowed to cool, and the

for 36–48h. The biomass was brieﬂy milled (e.g., 30–60s) in a

(25µg/L) was added to prevent spoilage. The reactions were
gentlymixed(50rpm)andincubatedat50◦Cfor72h.
Yeast were routinely grown in YPD (yeast extract, peptone
and dextrose medium formulated per L: 10g yeast extract,
20g peptone, and 20g dextrose) supplemented with agar when
preparing solid media (Bacto agar, 15 g/l). YP (yeast extract a nd
peptone) was sterilized by heating at 121◦C for 15min in an
autoclave (15min cycle) and supplemented with ﬁlter steriliz ed
glucose solution (400 g/l). Hydrolysates were ﬁlter sterili zed and
likewisesupplementedwithYPwithoutinclusionoftheglucose.
Separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) was used
for converting the biomass into ethanol. Hydrolysis and
fermentation was performed using 50ml Corning PyrexTMglass
wide-mouth screw cap bottles. The bottles were sealed with
solid orange caps during hydrolysis and substituted with sili con
foam caps for fermentation. For hydrolysis, 3.75g of LMA pre-
treated and air-dried biomass was diluted in 30.25ml of dH 2O
and adjusted to a pH of 4.8–5.0. Cellulase (CTEC3, 36 mg/
g gucan) and xylanase (HTEC2, 4.2 mg/g forage) were added
and biomass digested at 50◦C, while mixing at 150 rpm for
72husingashaker/incubator(Innova,NewBrunswickScient iﬁc,
NJ, USA). Bottles were cooled to 30◦C before adding 2.75ml
of 10x YP and sodium phosphate buﬀer (pH 6.5, 0.1M). The
medium was inoculated with S. stipitis to a beginning OD 600=

Analytical Methods
Sugars and fermentation production were determined using
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Samples
were injected (20 µL) onto a Spectra System HPLC system

RESULTS
Pelletization
Big bluestem, switchgrass, and a low-diversity prairie gras s
mixture, which consisted of BBS, indiangrass, and sideoats
grama, were separately pelletized at a commercial pellet feed
mill using ∼18 metric tons of each biomass. Diﬀerences in bulk
density are visually contrasted in Figure2. The straws were
condensed from a beginning density of 128–133 kg/m3to a
ﬁnal density of 528–554 kg/m3, which is a 407% increase in
bulk density across all biomasses. Pellet mean diameters (6 .52–
6.58mm) were close to the speciﬁed diameter (6.35mm) with
relatively low standard deviations (1.41–1.57%). A signiﬁc ant
diﬀerence was detected between the mean diameter of LDM vs.
SGpellets( p<0.05)(Table1).Thedistributionsofpelletweights
and lengths had large standard deviations and were skewed to
the right ( Table1). For example, relative standard deviations forpelletweightswere36.2–40.0%.LDMpelletsweighedmorethan

Composition and Milling
Compositions of the grasses were measured before and after
pelletization and had mass closures of 91.5–95.8% ( Table2).
Glucan and xylan contents (337 and 221 g/kg, db, respectively )
werewithintherangeofpreviouslyreportedresultsforpost-fr ost
harvested switchgrass (309–385 g/kg, db and 200–246 g/kg, d b),
albeit toward the lower end ( Dien et al., 2006, 2013; Kim et al.,
2011; Rijal et al., 2012; Wolfrum et al., 2017 ). BBS glucan and
xylan contents (340.1 and 199.6 g/kg, db) are in agreement wi th
NREL published results (362 and 212 g/kg, db) ( Wiselogel et al.,
1996).
Pelletization led to compositional changes for the grasses.
Biomass samples are prepared for compositional analysis by
extracting soluble material with water and ethanol solutio ns.
It is notable that pelletizing increased water-ethanol extr actable
material by 3–5% w/w across all three of the biomasses.
Pelletizing also decreased glucan and xylan contents by 1–3%
w/w. Diﬀerences in glucan and xylan contents between non-

Pre-treatment and Low-Solids Enzymatic
Conversion
The biomass samples were next evaluated for neutral sugar
yields using either LHW or LMA pre-treatment followed by
digestion with cellulases and hemicellulases. LHW (also ter med
hydrothermal) pre-treatment consists of simply heating the
biomass to a high temperature in water. The natural acidity of

Following the LHW pre-treatment, the whole hydrolysate is pH
adjusted to pH 5.0 and digested with a commercial cellulose

LMA pre-treated and sacchariﬁed samples, glucose yields (per
kg of beginning biomass) were 272–326 g/kg and the yield of
total fermentable sugars were 451–510 g/kg ( Figure5A ). This

Overall, yields were higher and more consistent across gras s

Ethanol Fermentation
Next, ethanol yields were compared following SHF. To
prepare biomass for ethanol fermentation, the diﬀerent biomas s
feedstockswerepre-treatedwithLMAandthewholehydrolysat e
sacchariﬁed at 10% w/w solids. LMA was selected over LHW
because sugar yields using the former were more consistent
across the diﬀerent biomass feedstocks. The hydrolysate was
supplemented with nutrients, and fermented to ethanol using S.
stipitisyeast.
Pre-treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis (e.g., pre-
fermentation) recovered 69.7–76.8% and 70.1–77.1% of the
available glucose and xylose, respectively ( Table4). Glucose
yields were slightly but signiﬁcantly ( p<0.05) lower for
SG vs. the other two grasses, as was also observed for LHW
pre-treatment. Xylose yields did not vary among species ( p>
0.05).
Glucose and xylose yields [g/kg, db] were reduced 6.4 and
9.4, respectively, for pellets vs. non-pellets averaged across
all biomasses ( p<0.05). This reduced yield can be directly
attributed to the lower sugar contents observed for pellets v s.non-pelletsbecausepelletsweremoredigestibleforglucose( p<
0.05, 3.3% greater glucose eﬃciency for pellets vs. non-pellet s)
and not statistically diﬀerent for xylose eﬃciencies ( p>0.05).
Overall, eﬃciencies at which free sugars were recovered were
less than observed for the low-solids hydrolysates, which is to
be expected because of increases in concentration of soluble
enzymeinhibitors(aceticacid,ligninderivedaromatics, etc.)and
end-productinhibition.

DISCUSSION
Composition and Pre-processing
Acrossthegroundgrasses,therewasnosigniﬁcantdiﬀerence sfor
glucan or xylan contents. Switchgrass did contain more acet ate
(35.7 g/kg vs. 29.7 g/kg), which is important because it can
adversely aﬀect fermentation. In addition, lignin content w as
lower for LDM (169.3 g/kg) compared to the other two grasses.
Most important, all three grass crops had similar theoretical
ethanol yields on a mass basis and for non-pellets this value
exceededthatofcornstover( Figure3).
If the biomass needs to be trucked to the factory gate,
densifying should allow for more eﬃcient transport. Trucks
operate most eﬀectively when ﬁlled with cargo to their weight
limit. For a truck with a trailer volume of 70–90 m3, this
requires a minimum bulk density of 270–320 kg/m3(Thoreson
et al., 2010 ). The mean bulk densities for the three pelletized
biomass samples (528–554 kg/m3) consistently exceed this limit
(Figure2).Incontrast,priortocompacting(128–135kg/m3),the
truckswouldbeoperatingat <50%eﬃciency.Thedenserpellets
are also expected to be more convenient to store vs. round bale s
or chopped grass or at least this was found to be the case in this
laboratory.
Bulk densities of grasses for diﬀerent presentations are
reviewed by Sokhansanj et al. (2009) . Ground SG (1.5mm
loose ﬁll) has a bulk density of 120 kg/m3, like that reported
here. Round baled SG is compressed to 140–180 kg/m3. Pellets
(6.24mm diameter) are reported as 500–700 kg/m3, though a
value below 400 kg/m3has also been reported ( Gilbert et al.,
2009). Pellet densities reported here fall within the accepted
range. Pellet properties vary based upon biomass feed moisture
and particle size as well as process temperature and pressure
(Tumuluru et al., 2011 ). Presumably, properties would also vary
with harvest maturity ( Tumuluru et al., 2011 ) and in that regard

post-frost harvest is recommended with ∼50–60% of shoot
nitrogen remobilized to the rhizomes ( Sarath et al., 2014 ). This
minimizes soil nutrient removal ( Dien et al., 2006; Sarath et al.,
2014) and helps to ensure a healthy productive stand, especially
whenunderdroughtconditions( MitchellandSchmer,2012 ).
Therefore, further studies are warranted to determine the
eﬀect of harvest maturity on pellet processing and feed value
in the event of dual use for SG. BBS has similar reported bulk

densities as SG: 46.6 kg/m3for chopped straw and 467–618
kg/m3forpellets( Theerarattananoonetal.,2012 ).Animportant
advantage of manufacturing pellets is the possibility of maki ng
a uniform feedstock using multiple readily available sources of
biomass ( Shi et al., 2013; Wolfrum et al., 2017 ), for a highly
favorable supply logistics outcome ( Ray et al., 2017 ). This study
demonstrates that it is likewise possible to manufacture pell ets
using heterogeneous grasses harvested from a ﬁeld planted wit h
multipleplantspecies.
Forming pellets led to small but signiﬁcant ( p<0.05)
decreases in glucans (2.6% on average) and xylans (1.7%) for
all the feedstocks. Most, but not all ( Theerarattananoon et al.,
2012; Wolfrum et al., 2017 ), previous studies also reported
decreased glucan (1–4%) and xylose (2–4%) contents for pellets
compared to beginning straws ( Rijal et al., 2012; Ray et al.,
2013; Shi et al., 2013; Bals et al., 2014 ). Varied results are not
surprisingbecausepelletizinginvolvesacombinationofhea tand
high pressure to compress biomass and form durable pellets.
Formation of durable pellets depends upon operating above
the glass transition state for lignin and forming cross link ages
between carbohydrates, lignin, and other plant cell componen ts
(Kaliyan and Morey, 2010; Tumuluru et al., 2011 ). Decreased
glucan and xylan contents did not appear to be correlated with
feedstock type. The techniques used here might also overlook
changes in lignin composition. Combinations of carbohydrat es
and lignin extractives form compounds termed pseudo-lignin,
which are detected as Klason lignin ( Sannigrahi et al., 2011 ).
Likewise, scale did not play a role, though this study is the ﬁr st
to use pellets made by an existing commercial plant. Finally,
the reader is cautioned that observed decreases in carbohyd rate
contents are near the practical detection limits of standard
analytical methods (1–3% relative standard deviations) us ed
to determine composition ( Templeton et al., 2010 ), which is
compounded in the case of mixtures by the opportunity for
additionalsamplingerror.

enzymatic hydrolysis. Two pre-treatments were selected forthis study: liquid hot-water and low moisture ammonium
pre-treatments. LHW involves pre-treating biomass at high
temperatures solely with water ( Mosier et al., 2005a ). LHW was
selected because it avoids the use of a mineral catalyst (e.g.,
sulfuric acid), has been reported to minimize the formation o f
furfural because xylan is not hydrolyzed all the way to xylose
(Mosier et al., 2005b ), and has been successfully applied in
the past to switchgrass ( Kim et al., 2011 ). LMA is similar to
low moisture anhydrous ammonium pre-treatment (LMAA)
(Yoo et al., 2011 ) but in which ammonium is added as a
concentrated ammonium hydroxide solution. LMA was selected
as a representative alkaline pre-treatment because it is simpl e to
implement, and ammonia pre-treated biomass does not require
extensive conditioning prior to fermentation ( Dien et al., 2013 ).

tank in order to save energy and capital costs ( Nghiem et al.,
2016). Two pre-treatment technologies were selected because
they reﬂect two diﬀerent chemistries (e.g., acid and base). LH W
and LMA pre-treated samples were assayed for sugar yields in
low-solids digestions. LMA pre-treated samples were also used
for two-stage high solids hydrolysis and ethanol fermentati on
(SHF).
LHW proved to be an eﬀective pre-treatment. Across
all samples, 72.5–81.8% of total neutral carbohydrates were
recovered as monosaccharides following treatment with
cellulasesandhemicellulases.ApriorstudyalsousingLHWand
switchgrass with similar analytical methods reported a high er
glucose yield ( >80% glucan vs. 70% here) and a comparable
xylan yield ( >80% xylan vs. 76% here) ( Kim et al., 2011 ). The
higher yield in this prior study could have arisen from using
diﬀerent SG varieties, a higher pre-treatment temperature
(200◦C vs. 190◦C), and a longer enzymatic hydrolysis time (168
vs.96h).
This is the ﬁrst study that we are aware of to apply
LMA/LMAA to SG ( Kim et al., 2016 ), and the glucose and
xylose recoveries reported here (85% of glucan and 76% of
xylan) are favorable compared to those reported using other
ammonia based pre-treatments with SG. One study that used
dilute ammonium hydroxide at lower solids (15%) and higher
temperatures (170◦C for 20min) than here, reported glucose

A signiﬁcant advantage of LMA pre-treatment is that
hydrolyzedsugarscanbefermentedtoethanolwithoutrequi ring
a conditioning step to remove inhibitors, as is often requir ed
in the case of dilute-acid pre-treatment. LMA biomasses were
converted to ethanol using a two-stage process: biomass was
hydrolyzed to sugars and the sugars fermented to ethanol. A
two-stageprocessallowedforoptimaltemperaturestobeapplied
for enzymatic hydrolysis (50◦C) and fermentation (30◦C). The
overall ethanol conversion eﬃciencies on a beginning bioma ss
basis were 63.7–71.1%, which includes ineﬃciencies incurre d
during hydrolysis and fermentation. Overall ethanol eﬃcie ncies
represent an advance from a prior study by this laboratory
using SG pre-treated with dilute ammonium hydroxide and
aSaccharomyces cerevisiae engineered for xylose fermentation
(41.0–56.4%oftheoretical)( Dienetal.,2013 ).
Comparison of Sugar and Ethanol Yields

Noreductioninconversionyieldswereobservedforpelleted and

hydrolysis eﬃciencies were mostly higher for pellets vs. non-

This conclusion that pelletization does not reduce

that use dilute-acid or ionic liquid did not observe a signiﬁ cant
diﬀerence in product yields between non-pellets and pellets
(Rijaletal.,2012;Theerarattananoonetal.,2012;Rayetal. ,2013;
Shi et al., 2013; Wolfrum et al., 2017 ) with one exception. Corn
stover pellets treated with a low severity dilute acid, washe d,
and converted using SSF gave a higher ethanol yield eﬃciency
(84% of theoretical) vs. the ground straw (68% of theoretica l)
(Rayetal.,2013 ).However,inthesamestudy,whenapilotscale
dilute-acid reactor was used, no diﬀerence was observed unde r
optimal reaction conditions. In general, high severity or mo re
eﬀective pre-treatments (e.g., ionic liquid) would hide subtl e
diﬀerences in biomass properties associated with pelletizing.
A study applying ammonium pre-treatment conducted at
ambient temperature using switchgrass did not reveal any
diﬀerences in glucan conversion, but xylan conversion was
increased 10% ( Rijal et al., 2012 ). A previously mentioned study
that used SAA reported a 76% improvement in glucose yield
from pelletizing ( Nahar and Pryor, 2014 ). Processes that used
AFEX pre-processed pellets did not report improved hydrolysis
sugar yields, perhaps, because AFEX is a highly eﬀective pre-
treatment on herbaceous biomass in general. However, one of
the AFEX studies emphasized that lower adsorption of water
by the pellets compared to the straw led to a more eﬃcient
hydrolysis at high-solids because biomass did not need to be
fed into the reactor over time ( Bals et al., 2014 ). We have also
observed noticeably more free water is present following hig h-
solids dilute-acid pre-treatment of SG pellets vs. ground stra w

(personal observation by Dien). In summary, pelletizing does
not lower product yields and might slightly promote conversio n
eﬃciency.
Theaforementionedlogisticaladvantageshavetobebalanc ed
against the added cost and energy inputs associated with
making pellets. A typical bioreﬁnery is expected to be scaled
to process 2,000 Mg/day of biomass. At this scale, baled SG
is estimated to cost $80.64 /Mg at the factory gate and baling
and transport will consume equivalent to 8.5% of the higher
heating value (HHV) of the biomass. In contrast to baled SG,
pellets are estimated to cost less ($71.76/Mg) and consume
less energy (7.8% HHV) ( Sokhansanj et al., 2009 ). The major
energy used to make pellets goes to drying the biomass. It
has been suggested adapting the process for bioenergy crops
to increase drying eﬃciency can aﬀord considerable energy
and cost savings ( Lamers et al., 2015 ). However, densifying the
biomass may be necessary to reduce ﬁnancial risks associate d
with relying on a regional feedstock. In other words, increa sed
investor risk has an associated cost and eliminating this ri sk
is expected to more than make up for the cost of pelletizing
(Hansenetal.,2015 ).
Comparison of Feedstocks
There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence among the samples based
uponethanolyieldsfollowingSHF.However,standarddeviat ions

hydrolysis step perhaps because of the added yeast fermentati on
step. In this case, BBS and LDM had signiﬁcantly higher glucos e
yields compared to that of SG. Xylose yields were similar amon g
the grasses. The 3-year average biomass yields for BBS, LDM,
and SG were 7.4, 9.4, and 9.6 Mg/ha. Therefore, diﬀerences
in conversion yields are minor compared to those observed
for biomass production. These crop productivities translate to
ethanol production levels of 1,952, 2,586, and 2,636l of etha nol
perha.
CONCLUSION
Three new ﬁeld grown bioenergy grass crops were compared
for composition, response to commercial scaled pelleting,
and processing to sugars and ethanol. LDM had a higher
glucan content than either BBS or SG ( p≤0.01) but no
diﬀerences were observed for total fermentable carbohydrat es
and ethanol yields per ton of biomass. On a land basis, theestimatedproductivitieswere1,952,2,586,and2,636lofet hanol
perha.
The use of pellets compared to straw does not impact sugar
and ethanol yields. This was found to be the case with LHW
(sugars) and LMA (sugars and ethanol) pre-treatments. We did
see a slight reduction in glucan and xylan contents associate d
with the pellets ( p=0.014), which agrees with most but not all
prior reports. The conﬂicting conclusions might be attribute d
to (in this case) use of a commercial scale feed plant and likely
variation in conditions used to form pellets across studies. T his
study demonstrates the promise of BBS, LDM, and SG for
bioenergyproductionandnotablydemonstratestheirprocessi ng
fromﬁeldthroughfermentation.Futureresearchwillbedire cted
at evaluating additional production years of the LDM and to
further improve biomass yields for BBS, so it is comparable to
theothertwocropsusedinthisstudy.
