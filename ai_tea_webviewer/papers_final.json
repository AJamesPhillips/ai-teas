We studied the effect of harvest timing on the conversion yields, using two algal strains; Chlorella and Scenedesmus, generating biomass with distinctive compositional ratios of protein, carbohydrate, and lipids. We found that the late harvest Scenedesmus biomass had the maximum theoretical biofuel potential at 143 gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE) combined fuel yield per dry ton biomass, followed by late harvest Chlorella at 128 GGE per ton. Our experimental data show a clear difference between the two strains, as Scenedesmus was more successfully converted in this process with a demonstrated 97 GGE per ton.

This method stands out due to its use of dilute-phosphoric-acid-steam-explosion for pretreatment, as opposed to the more traditional dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment. The utilization of genetically modified Escherichia coli as the fermentation biocatalyst enables the co-fermentation of both hexose and pentose sugars, which are derived from lignocellulosic biomass, into ethanol. This approach not only simplifies the overall process by eliminating the need for separate hydrolysis and fermentation steps but also mitigates issues associated with high solids loading, thereby reducing the risks of contamination and improving product yields.\\n\\nNotably, the study underscores the critical importance of optimizing the ethanol yield to enhance the economic feasibility of cellulosic ethanol production. The analysis indicates that the primary factors influencing the minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) are feedstock and capital costs, which together account for a significant portion of the production expenses.

This approach presents a novel and simplified methodology for the production of lignocellulosic ethanol, leveraging a combination of process innovations and genetic engineering. \\n\\nKey Novel Aspects:\\n\\n1. **Use of L+SScF Process**: The L+SScF process integrates the steps of liquefaction, saccharification (the enzymatic breakdown of complex sugars into simpler sugars), and co-fermentation (simultaneous fermentation of hexoses and pentoses into ethanol) into a single, streamlined operation. This integration is significant because it simplifies the overall process, potentially reducing both capital and operational costs.\\n\\n2. **Genetically Engineered Escherichia coli**: The process utilizes a genetically modified E. coli strain capable of co-fermenting both five-carbon sugars (pentoses) and six-carbon sugars (hexoses) derived from sugarcane bagasse. This broad range of sugar utilization is crucial for maximizing ethanol yields from lignocellulosic biomass, where both hexoses and pentoses are abundant.\\n\\n3. **Dilute-Phosphoric-Acid-Steam Explosion Pretreatment**: Unlike more conventional acid hydrolysis methods that might use sulfuric acid, this approach uses dilute phosphoric acid combined with steam explosion. This method helps in achieving high sugar yields necessary for fermentation while potentially reducing the corrosiveness of the reaction environment, which could lower the costs associated with reactor materials.\\n\\n4. **Process Simplification Advances**: The study identifies several areas for process simplification that could contribute to reducing the minimum ethanol selling price (MESP).

Considerable research and development has focused on using circulating-bed reactors with zeolite catalysts (e.g., HZSM-5) for CFP because of their propensity to form gasoline-range aromatic hydrocarbons. However, the high selectivity for aromatics comes at the expense of low carbon yield, a key economic driver for this process. In this contribution, we evaluate non-zeolite catalysts in a fixed-bed reactor configuration for an integrated CFP process to produce fuel blendstocks from lignocellulosic biomass. These experimental efforts are coupled with technoeconomic analysis (TEA) to benchmark the process and guide research and development activities to minimize costs. The results indicate that CFP bio-oil can be produced from pine with improved yield by using a bifunctional metal-acid 2 wt% Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor operated with co-fed H-2 at near atmospheric pressure, as compared to H-ZSM5 in a circulating-bed reactor. The Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst exhibited good stability over 13 reaction-regeneration cycles with no evidence of irreversible deactivation. The CFP bio-oil was continuously hydrotreated for 140 h time-on-stream using a single-stage system with 84 wt% of the hydrotreated product having a boiling point in the gasoline and distillate range. This integrated biomass-to-blendstock process was determined to exhibit an energy efficiency of 50% and a carbon efficiency of 38%, based on the experimental results and process modelling. TEA of the integrated process revealed a modelled minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of $4.34 per gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE), which represents a cost reduction of $0.85 GGE(-1) compared to values reported for CFP with a zeolite catalyst. TEA also indicated that catalyst cost was a significant factor influencing the MFSP, which informed additional CFP experiments in which lower-cost Mo<sub>2</sub>C and high-dispersion 0.5 wt% Pt/TiO2 catalysts were synthesized and evaluated. These materials demonstrated CFP carbon yield and oil oxygen content similar to those of the 2 wt% Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst, offering proof-of-concept that the lower-cost catalysts can be effective for CFP and providing a route to reduce the modelled MFSP to $3.86-3.91 GGE(-1).

However, due to the low amounts of oil produced per hectare from temperate oilseed crops (e.g. soybean), the opportunities for further increasing biodiesel production are limited. Genetically modified lipid-producing sugarcane (lipid-cane) possesses great potential for producing biodiesel as an alternative feedstock because of sugarcane\\u2019s much higher productivity compared with soybean. In this study, techno-economic models were developed for biodiesel and ethanol coproduction from lipid-cane, assuming 2, 5, 10, or 20% lipid concentration in the harvested stem (dry mass basis). The models were compared with a conventional soybean biodiesel process model to assess lipid-cane\\u2019s competiveness. In the lipid-cane process model, the extracted lipids were used to produce biodiesel by transesterifi cation, and the remaining sugar was used to produce ethanol by fermentation. The results showed that the biodiesel production cost from lipid-cane decreased from $0.89/L to $0.59 /L as the lipid content increased from 2 to 20%; this cost was lower than that obtained for soybeans ($1.08/L). The ethanol production costs from lipid-cane were between $0.40/L and $0.46/L. The internal rate of return (IRR) for the soybean biodiesel process was 15.0%, and the IRR for the lipid-cane process went from 13.7 to 24.0% as the lipid content increased from 2 to 20%. Because of its high productivity, lipid-cane with 20% lipid content can produce 6700 L of biodiesel from each hectare of land, whereas soybean can only produce approximately 500 L of biodiesel from each hectare of land. This would indicate that continued efforts to achieve lipid-producing sugarcane could make large-scale replacement of fossil-fuel-derived diesel without unrealistic demands on land area.\", \"publication_date\": \"2016-03-07T00:00:00Z\", \"entry_date\": \"2021-10-25T00:00:00Z\", \"publisher\": \"Wiley\", \"journal_name\": \"Biofuels, Bioproducts & Biorefining\", \"journal_issue\": \"3\", \"journal_volume\": \"10\", \"format\": \"Medium: ED; Size: p. 299-315\", \"authors\": [\"Huang, Haibo [Virginia Polytechnic Inst. and State Univ.

There is significant ongoing research on the design and development of catalysts for this process. However, there are a limited number of studies investigating process configurations and their effects on biorefinery economics. Herein we present a conceptual process design with techno-economic assessment; it includes the production of upgraded bio-oil via fixed bed ex situ catalytic fast pyrolysis followed by final hydroprocessing to hydrocarbon fuel blendstocks. This study builds upon previous work using fluidized bed systems, as detailed in a recent design report led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL/TP-5100-62455); overall yields are assumed to be similar, and are based on enabling future feasibility. Assuming similar yields provides a basis for easy comparison and for studying the impacts of areas of focus in this study, namely, fixed bed reactor configurations and their catalyst development requirements, and the impacts of an inline hot gas filter. A comparison with the fluidized bed system shows that there is potential for higher capital costs and lower catalyst costs in the fixed bed system, leading to comparable overall costs. The key catalyst requirement is to enable the effective transformation of highly oxygenated biomass into hydrocarbons products with properties suitable for blending into current fuels. Potential catalyst materials are discussed, along with their suitability for deoxygenation, hydrogenation and C\\u2013C coupling chemistry. This chemistry is necessary during pyrolysis vapor upgrading for improved bio-oil quality, which enables efficient downstream hydroprocessing; C\\u2013C coupling helps increase the proportion of diesel/jet fuel range product. One potential benefit of fixed bed upgrading over fluidized bed upgrading is catalyst flexibility, providing greater control over chemistry and product composition. Since this study is based on future projections, the impacts of uncertainties in the underlying assumptions are quantified via sensitivity analysis. As a result, this analysis indicates that catalyst researchers should prioritize by: carbon efficiency > catalyst cost > catalyst lifetime, after initially testing for basic operational feasibility.\", \"publication_date\": \"2015-10-06T00:00:00Z\", \"entry_date\": \"2023-06-26T00:00:00Z\", \"publisher\": \"Springer\", \"journal_name\": \"Topics in Catalysis\", \"journal_issue\": \"1\", \"journal_volume\": \"59\", \"format\": \"Medium: ED; Size: 17 p.\", \"authors\": [\"Dutta, Abhijit [National Renewable Energy Lab.

In California, woody biomass comprises the largest fraction of underutilized biomass available for biofuel production, but conversion to fuels is challenged both by recalcitrance to deconstruction and by toxicity toward downstream saccharification and fermentation due to organic acids and phenolic compounds generated during pretreatment. In this study, we optimize pretreatment and scale-up of an integrated one-pot process for deconstruction of California woody biomass using the ionic liquid (IL) cholinium lysinate [Ch][Lys] as a pretreatment solvent. By evaluating the impact of solid loading, solid removal, yeast acclimatization, fermentation temperature, fermentation pH, and nutrient supplementation on final ethanol yields and titers, we achieve nearly full conversion of both glucose and xylose to ethanol with commercial C5-utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We then demonstrate process scalability in 680 L pilot-scale fermentation, achieving >80% deconstruction efficiency, >90% fermentation efficiency, 27.7 g/L ethanol titer, and >80% ethanol distillation efficiency from the IL-containing hydrolysate post fermentation.

Given that algae has been demonstrated as both a potential biofuel and a food product, it is important to consider the environmental and economic tradeoffs associated with these uses.

We show, in stochastic price regimes for production inputs and outputs, that the greatest returns are achieved when algal biomass is valorized as a high value fishmeal replacement. A co-production technology strategy that valorizes extracted oils as fuel and residual biomass as fishmeal replacement can enable the economic production of a renewable biofuel. Consistent with other studies, fuel-only production remains uneconomical, but becomes preferred if a low value commodity crop substitute is considered as the rendered food product. Potential improvements in capital and operational costs to enable economic production of fuel and low-value food are explored. Multimodal biorefineries ensure continued production during periods that are economically unfavorable with a single-mode approach, but have lower returns due to larger upfront capital investment. An analysis of a biorefinery with fuel, food, and coproduction modes demonstrated that mode selection was mostly influenced by output product prices when food and energy prices were competitive. Nitrogen fertilizer prices had a moderate influence on mode selection, while other inputs (phosphorus, electricity, natural gas) had negligible influence. The application of a carbon tax places a penalty on food production, but improves returns when renewable electricity is utilized in production.

The integration of HRAD post-HTL treatment efficiently handles the dilute aqueous phase from HTL, which is less suitable for traditional AD, therefore optimizing the energy recovery process by ensuring higher biogas yield. This integrated approach, leveraging the benefits of both AD and HRAD, signifies a step forward in enhancing the energy valorization of agricultural wastes.', 'options': {}, 'parameters': [{'name': 'organic_loading_rate', 'unit': 'kg VS/(m^3·d)'}], 'output': {'name': 'biogas', 'unit': 'm3/day'}}], 'process_target': 'biogas'}"

We selected the most accurate machine learning approach (a variation of the random forest approach) to predict future trends in sorghum yields under four greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios and two irrigation regimes. We identified irrigation practices, vapor pressure deficit, and time (a proxy for technological improvement) as the most important predictors of sorghum productivity. Our results showed a decreasing trend of sorghum yields over future years (on average 2.7% from 2018 to 2099), with greater decline under a high GHG emissions scenario (3.8%) and in the absence of irrigation (4.6%). Geographically, we observed the steepest predicted declines in the Great Lakes (8.2%), Upper Midwest (7.5%), and Heartland (6.7%) regions. Our study demonstrates the use of machine learning to identify environmental controllers of sorghum biomass yield and predict yields with reasonable accuracy. These results can inform the development of more realistic biomass supply projections for bioenergy if sorghum production is scaled up. \\u00a9 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd\\n </p>\", \"publication_date\": \"2020-02-05T00:00:00Z\", \"entry_date\": \"2022-05-30T00:00:00Z\", \"journal_name\": \"Biofuels, Bioproducts & Biorefining\", \"format\": \"Medium: ED; Size: p. 566-577\", \"authors\": [\"Huntington, Tyler [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The process swells the biomass, decreases crystallinity of the cellulose, and partially removes lignin, without substantially altering its composition. A unique aspect of this method is its applicability to a wide range of biomass types, including agricultural residues like corn stover, wheat straw, and hardwoods, enhancing their digestibility. AFEX is an environmentally friendly option as the ammonia can be recovered and recycled, reducing the overall process cost and impact on the environment. This feature also avoids the generation of inhibitory compounds that could hamper microbial fermentation, a common challenge in other pretreatment strategies.

It serves as a building block for a wide variety of plastics, textiles, and chemicals, and can be converted into liquid transportation fuels. There is great interest in the development of technologies that produce ethylene from renewable resources, such as biologically derived CO<sub>2</sub> and biomass. One of the metabolic pathways used by microbes to produce ethylene is via an ethylene-forming enzyme (EFE). By expressing a bacterial EFE gene in a cyanobacterium, ethylene has been produced through photosynthetic carbon fixation.

This process effectively alters the lignocellulosic structure of biomass, making the cellulose more accessible to enzymes for subsequent hydrolysis and fermentation steps essential for biofuel production. The novelty in utilizing the AFEX™ pretreatment lies in its integration within a decentralized depot-based biorefinery system, allowing for large-scale processing adjacent to coal-fired power plants in urban areas. This configuration leverages existing transportation systems for biomass delivery from various production areas to the depot facilities, significantly optimizing logistics and reducing costs associated with biomass handling and pretreatment.

The innovation lies in the integration of CDR technologies with biofuel production to create biofuels that are not just carbon-neutral but carbon-negative, achieving lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of ≤ -22.2 gCO2 MJ^-1. The production process involves harvesting and processing cellulosic feedstock (corn stover and switchgrass), which is then converted into ethanol.

To this end, a data set was assembled consisting of 570 data points appearing in the open literature.

This traditional bio-industrial process entails growing algae in shallow bodies of water, such as natural or artificial ponds, exposing the algae directly to sunlight and ambient conditions. Algal growth in open raceway ponds (ORP), a common type of open pond system, is highly susceptible to variations in environmental factors, particularly solar irradiance and water temperature. These factors, along with others like relative humidity and wind speed, significantly influence the biomass productivity of algae. The process's reliance on natural light and temperature conditions makes it inherently variable, with productivity likely fluctuating on an annual, seasonal, and intra-seasonal basis due to changes in weather. This susceptibility to weather uncertainties poses biophysical and financial risks to algal biofuel production, impacting not only the biomass yield but also the associated revenues from biofuel production. The study mentioned in the text highlights this by exploring the performance of a hypothetical algal biorefinery in Vero Beach, Florida, using stochastic weather generation, biophysical growth modelling, stochastic market price generation, and techno-economic analysis to examine the effects of weather uncertainty on biomass growth and biorefinery revenues, as well as the impacts from market price variability.

This clustering facilitates the subsequent phase of harvesting by allowing for the more efficient separation of the algae from the water in which it is suspended. In algal biofuel production, effective flocculation is essential for concentrating the algal biomass before further processing, such as lipid extraction for biofuel production. The novelty in processing steps related to harvesting and flocculation can occur in the development of more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly flocculants, or the conditions under which flocculation is induced, such as adjustments in pH, the introduction of electrochemical flocculation methods, or the use of biological flocculants like certain strains of bacteria or fungi that can promote algal clumping without the need for chemical additives. Enhanced flocculation methods can significantly reduce the energy and cost requirements of the harvesting phase, which is often one of the most energy-intensive parts of the biofuel production process.

To address this, the authors propose a novel hybrid processing approach that integrates a high temperature pre-digestion step using hyperthermophilic enzyme cocktails, derived from organisms like Acidothermus cellulolyticus and Caldicellulosiruptor bescii, prior to conventional saccharification using commercial enzyme preparations. This approach leverages the thermal stability of hyperthermophilic enzymes to initiate biomass digestion at elevated temperatures, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the subsequent saccharification and improving overall product yields.\\n\\nThe novelty lies in the employment of a high-temperature pre-digestion step that allows the use of thermophilic enzymes to act on the biomass during the inherent cooling period required by conventional processes. By introducing thermophilic enzymes at temperatures higher than what is tolerable by commercial cellulases, this method utilizes time that would otherwise be spent waiting for the biomass to cool. This not only saves time but also significantly enhances the conversion rates and yields of fermentable sugars compared to traditional methods.

Furthermore, the environmental impact and economic feasibility of this novel ENP-based approach were evaluated through life-cycle assessment (LCA) and life-cycle costing (LCC), indicating that while costs may be higher than conventional methods, the efficiency of carbon capture could significantly improve, making ENP-based AOF a viable component of climate change mitigation strategies. The process environmental impact assessment and toxicity analysis reveal that ENPs, with careful selection and application, could revolutionize AOF by overcoming existing barriers, enhancing the sustainability of atmospheric CO2 sequestration efforts.', 'options': {}, 'parameters': [{'name': 'LC50_concentration', 'unit': 'mg/L'}], 'output': {'name': 'toxic_substances_released', 'unit': 'kg/day'}}], 'process_target': 'co2_capture'}"

Additionally, defining the future location and supply logistics of conversion plants is imperative to ultimately transform the nation\\u2019s renewable biomass resources into cost-competitive, high-performance feedstock for production of biofuels and bioproducts. Since the US has put restrictions on production levels of conventional biofuels from edible resources, the nation needs to plan for the widespread accessibility and development of the cellulosic biofuel scenario. Conventional feedstock supply systems will be unable to handle cellulosic biomass nationwide, making it essential to expand the industry with an advanced feedstock supply system incorporating a distributed network of preprocessing depots and conversion plants, or biorefineries. Current studies are mostly limited to designing supply systems for specific regions of the country. We developed a national database with potential locations for depots and biorefineries to meet the nation\\u2019s target demand of cellulosic biofuel. Blended feedstock with switchgrass and corn stover (harvested by either a two- or three-pass method) are considered in a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model to deliver on-spec biomass that considers both, a desired quantity and quality at the biorefinery. The model solves for a network of varying size depots that supply to biorefineries of 725,000 dry tons/year. A total delivered feedstock cost that is less than 79.07 dollars per dry tons (2016 dollars) is evaluated for years 2022, 2030, and 2040. In 2022, 124 depots and 59 biorefineries could be supplied with 42.8 million dt of corn stover and switchgrass. In 2030 and 2040, the total accessible biomass could increase to 215% and 393% respectively when compared to 2022. However, an 8 dollar per dry tons reduction in targeted delivery cost could reduce total accessible biomass by 67%. Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and Texas were identified as potential states with a strong biofuel economy given that they had six or more biorefineries located in all scenarios. In some scenarios, Colorado, Alabama, Georgia, Minnesota, Mississippi and South Carolina would greatly benefit from a depot network as these could only deliver to a biorefinery in a nearby state. To elaborate the impact of a nationwide consideration, the findings were compared with existing literature for different US regions.

This modified process approach, especially the acid-based anthocyanin extraction, not only diversifies product streams thus enhancing potential revenue but also presents an economically feasible alternative by reducing ethanol production costs compared to conventional ethanol production from corn stover. A significant novelty is in the tailored extraction process which leverages the high anthocyanin content in purple corn cobs and integrates it with ethanol production, optimizing the feedstock's value. The spray drying step, crucial for converting the anthocyanin extract into a stable and marketable powder form, underscores the process innovation in stabilizing natural colorants for industrial use. The capital investment for incorporating anthocyanin production, particularly through spray drying, contributes notably to the process economics, due to the high initial equipment and operational costs.

In the context of producing ethanol and anthocyanin coproducts from purple corn stover, the SSF process plays a critical role. The novelty of this integrated process lies in the utilization of purple corn stover, not only as a feedstock for bioethanol production through SSF but also for extracting valuable anthocyanins.

This distilled ethanol is then denatured with gasoline. This technique is traditional for ethanol production, but its novelty lies in the concurrent extraction of anthocyanin using either dilute acid or water-based processes prior to the ethanol production phase, which introduces a unique variation to the conventional ethanol recovery and distillation process.

This study assesses how low-cost modifications in the feedstock supply chain can be transformed into targeted pretreatments in the context of the entire bioenergy supply chain. The aim of this research is to overcome the physiochemical barriers in corn stover that necessitate increased severity in conversion in terms of chemical loading, temperature, and residence time. Corn stover samples were inoculated with a selective (Ceriporiopsis subvermispora) and non-selective (Phaenarochaete chrysosporium) lignin degrading filamentous fungal strains, then stored aerobically to determine the working envelope for fungal pretreatment to achieve lignin degradation. Dry matter loss and gross chemical makeup of corn stover varied by the length of treatment (2 and 4 weeks) and by the moisture content of the treated corn stover samples (40 and 60%, wet basis). Dry matter loss in P. chrysosporium inoculated biomass was elevated compared to the C. subvermispora inoculated biomass; however, treatment also induced additional chemical composition changes suggestive of depolymerization. Scanning electron microscope images reveal hyphae attached within cell lumen and suggest structural changes within P. chrysosporium treated corn stover after 60% moisture storage. These results highlight that fungal treatment approaches must balance loss of convertible material with the potential for reduction in recalcitrance.

The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) derived from carinata (Brassica carinata) could reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the aviation sector in the United States. Therefore, it is important to estimate changes in farm economics with and without carinata for ascertaining its production feasibility. In this context, the current study first assesses a combination of 12 popular rotations of corn, cotton, peanut, and soybean with winter crops of winter wheat and carinata in South Georgia over 4\\u00a0years. Then, the net present values (NPVs) of 292 feasible cropping systems over 4\\u00a0years are calculated. Finally, this study develops a risk model for ascertaining the probability distributions of NPVs for selected cropping systems subject to uncertainties related to prices and yields of summer and winter crops. Carinata in the corn-corn-soybean rotation has the highest NPV ($\\\\$$2,996/ha). The least risky rotation is cotton-cotton-peanut, with a 58.9% probability of a positive NPV. Carinata can decrease the risk level of crop rotations by 8.1%, only if a contract price of $\\\\$$440.9/t is offered. Therefore, a risk averse, risk neutral, or risk acceptant farmer can potentially include carinata in the rotation. Overall, carinata would increase the profitability of farm operations and decrease risk in the SE United States, and therefore, a high likelihood exists, that farmers would adopt it for meeting the growing demand for SAF in the United States.\", \"publication_date\": \"2022-05-10T00:00:00Z\", \"entry_date\": \"2022-10-17T00:00:00Z\", \"publisher\": \"Frontiers Research Foundation\", \"journal_name\": \"Frontiers in Energy Research\", \"journal_issue\": \"NA\", \"journal_volume\": \"10\", \"format\": \"Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 830227\", \"authors\": [\"Karami, Omid [Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN (United States); University of Georgia, Athens, GA (United States)]\", \"Dwivedi, Puneet [University of Georgia, Athens, GA (United States)]\", \"Lamb, Marshall [US Dept. of Agriculture (USDA), Dawson, GA (United States)]\", \"Field, John L.

Distillation, a widely used separation technique in the chemical process industry, helps in increasing the concentration of ethanol by separating it from water and other components based on differences in boiling points. However, because ethanol forms an azeotrope with water at around 95% ethanol concentration, simple distillation cannot achieve the anhydrous ethanol required for fuel use (99.5+%).

The pretreatment involves setting an inlet stream, composed primarily of a hemicellulose-rich extract from mixed hardwood chips, to a pressure of 6.15 bar and a temperature of 160 °C. The high pressure and temperature conditions facilitate the flash evaporation of a quarter of the water present in the stream.

Previous techno-economic analyses (TEAs) of HTL have been used to estimate the minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of biofuel products, but these analyses often assume a bespoke plant design where each plant operates under unique process conditions and neglect transportation costs. However, transportation costs must be included in realistic TEAs, and further, a mass-produced fixed-scale modular plant design approach may be more effective than case-by-case plant design, provided that there is sufficient market capacity to benefit from modularization. This study estimates fuel price behavior in the presence of transportation costs and benefits stemming from modular plant design. This analysis indicates that a modular process capable of handling 60 dry tons per day (DTPD) is optimal, resulting in a ~25% reduction in MFSP (from $4.70/GGE, fully upgraded) at complete market feedstock utilization compared with case-by-case design.

Several HTL deployment \\u201croadmaps\\u201d are then explored, with each roadmap consisting of different periods of case-by-case design followed by adoption of a modularized approach. A period of nonmodular industry growth up to market saturation of ~7% followed by implementation of modular plant design strikes a balance between the investment risk and learned cost reductions associated with modular plant design. However, if bespoke plants built during this period of nonmodular growth saturate more than 23% of available feedstock, learned cost reductions are significantly diminished.

The process involves several steps, starting with the pretreatment of biomass to release fermentable sugars, followed by the enzymatic hydrolysis where enzymes break down complex sugars into simple sugars. The fermentation step utilizes microorganisms such as yeast or bacteria to convert these simple sugars into ethanol.

This breakdown enhances the accessibility of cellulose and lignin for enzymatic attack, making the biomass more amenable to subsequent bioconversion processes, such as enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation. The process leverages the concept of using water as a green solvent, exploiting its properties under high-temperature conditions to hydrolyze hemicellulose into fermentable sugars without adding external chemicals, thereby offering an environmentally benign alternative to acid or alkali pretreatment methods.

Previous research assessing the profitability of algae products has been mostly based on values averaged over time, but algae production and resulting financial returns exhibit significant variability due to weather and fluctuations in selling prices for algae-based products. In other sectors, producers often reduce weather- and market price-related financial risk with financial instruments such as insurance, but little research has been performed on the design of insurance products to protect algae producers. Furthermore, this study develops a novel index-based insurance instrument that pays-out during unfavorable weather and market conditions, then explores the instrument's effectiveness, combined with a cash reserve, in reducing revenue stream variability for an algae producer. Results indicate that a biophysically based index-insurance product tailored to the specific financial risks in algae production can reduce variability in net revenues and can do so at a lower cost than relying solely on cash reserves, the most common financial risk management tool.
